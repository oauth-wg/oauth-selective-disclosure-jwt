1.  Introduction

   This document specifies conventions for creating JSON Web Signature
   (JWS) [RFC7515] structures with JSON [RFC8259] objects as the payload
   while supporting selective disclosure of individual elements of that
   JSON.  Because JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] is a very prevalent
   application of JWS with a JSON payload, the selective disclosure of
   JWT claims receives primary treatment herein.  However, that does not
   preclude the mechanism's applicability to other or more general
   applications of JWS with JSON payloads.

   The JSON-based representation of claims in a signed JWT is secured
   against modification using JWS digital signatures.  A consumer of a
   signed JWT that has checked the signature can safely assume that the
   contents of the token have not been modified.  However, anyone
   receiving an unencrypted JWT can read all the claims.  Likewise,
   anyone with the decryption key receiving encrypted JWT can also read
   all the claims.

   One of the common use cases of a signed JWT is representing a user's
   identity.  As long as the signed JWT is one-time use, it typically
   only contains those claims the user has consented to disclose to a
   specific Verifier.  However, there is an increasing number of use
   cases where a signed JWT is created once and then used a number of
   times by the user (the "Holder" of the JWT).  In such use cases, the
   signed JWT needs to contain the superset of all claims the user of
   the signed JWT might want to disclose to Verifiers at some point.
   The ability to selectively disclose a subset of these claims
   depending on the Verifier becomes crucial to ensure minimum
   disclosure and prevent Verifiers from obtaining claims irrelevant for
   the transaction at hand.  SD-JWTs defined in this document enable
   such selective disclosure of JWT claims.

   One example of a multi-use JWT is a verifiable credential, an Issuer-
   signed credential that contains the claims about a subject, and whose
   authenticity can be cryptographically verified.

   Similar to the JWT specification on which it builds, this document is
   a product of the Web Authorization Protocol (oauth) working group.
   However, while both JWT and SD-JWT have potential OAuth 2.0
   applications, their utility and application is certainly not
   constrained to OAuth 2.0.  JWT was developed as a general-purpose
   token format and has seen widespread usage in a variety of
   applications.  SD-JWT is a selective disclosure mechanism for JWT and
   is similarly intended to be general-purpose specification.

   While JWTs with claims describing natural persons are a common use
   case, the mechanisms defined in this document can be used for other
   use cases as well.

   In an SD-JWT, claims can be hidden, but cryptographically protected
   against undetected modification.  "Claims" here refers to both object
   properties (name-value pairs) as well as array elements.  When
   issuing the SD-JWT to the Holder, the Issuer includes the cleartext
   counterparts of all hidden claims, the so-called Disclosures, outside
   the signed part of the SD-JWT.

   The Holder decides which claims to disclose to a particular Verifier
   and includes the respective Disclosures in the SD-JWT to that
   Verifier.  The Verifier has to verify that all disclosed claim values
   were part of the original Issuer-signed JWT.  The Verifier will not,
   however, learn any claim values not disclosed in the Disclosures.

   This document also defines a format for SD-JWTs with Key Binding (SD-
   JWT+KB).  By optionally sending an SD-JWT+KB to a Verifier, the
   Holder can prove to the Verifier that they hold the private key
   associated to the SD-JWT (i.e., using the cnf claim [RFC7800]).  The
   strength of the binding is conditional upon the trust in the
   protection of the private key of the key pair an SD-JWT is bound to.

   SD-JWT can be used with any JSON-based representation of claims,
   including JSON-LD.

   This specification aims to be easy to implement and to leverage
   established and widely used data formats and cryptographic algorithms
   wherever possible.

1.1.  Feature Summary

   This specification defines two primary data formats:

   1.  SD-JWT is a composite structure enabling selective disclosure of
       its contents.  The definition in this document comprises the
       following:

       *  A format for enabling selective disclosure in nested JSON data
          structures, supporting selectively disclosable object
          properties (name-value pairs) and array elements
       *  A format for encoding the selectively disclosable data items
       *  A format extending the JWS Compact Serialization, allowing for
          the combined transport of the Issuer-signed JSON data
          structure and the disclosable data items
       *  An alternate format extending the JWS JSON Serialization, also
          allowing for transport of the Issuer-signed JSON data
          structure and disclosure data

   2.  SD-JWT+KB is a composite structure enabling cryptographic key
       binding when presented to the Verifier.  The definition in this
       document comprises the following:

       *  A facility for associating an SD-JWT to a key pair
       *  A format for a Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT) that proves possession
          of the private key of the associated key pair
       *  A format extending the SD-JWT format for the combined
          transport of the SD-JWT and the KB-JWT

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *base64url* denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   Selective disclosure:  Process of a Holder disclosing to a Verifier a
      subset of claims contained in a claim set issued by an Issuer.
   Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT):  A composite structure,
      consisting of an Issuer-signed JWT (JWS, [RFC7515]) and zero or
      more Disclosures, which supports selective disclosure as defined
      in this document.  It can contain both regular claims and digests
      of selectively-disclosable claims.
   Disclosure:  A JSON array containing a combination of a salt, a
      cleartext claim name (present when the claim is a name-value pair
      and absent when the claim is an array element), and a cleartext
      claim value, which is base64url-encoded and used to calculate a
      digest for the respective claim.  The term Disclosure refers to
      the whole base64url-encoded string.
   Key Binding:  Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of
      an SD-JWT by proving control over a private key during the
      presentation.  When utilizing Key Binding, an SD-JWT contains the
      public key corresponding to the private key controlled by the
      Holder (or a reference to this public key).
   Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT):  A JWT for proving Key Binding as defined
      in Section 5.3.  A Key Binding JWT is said to "be tied to" a
      particular SD-JWT when its payload includes a hash of the SD-JWT
      in its sd_hash claim.
   Selectively Disclosable JWT with Key Binding (SD-JWT+KB):  A
      composite structure, comprising an SD-JWT and a Key Binding JWT
      tied to that SD-JWT.
   Issuer:  An entity that creates SD-JWTs.
   Holder:  An entity that received SD-JWTs from the Issuer and has
      control over them.
   Verifier:  An entity that requests, checks, and extracts the claims
      from an SD-JWT with its respective Disclosures.

4.  Concepts

   This section describes SD-JWTs with their respective Disclosures and
   Key Binding at a conceptual level, abstracting from the data formats
   described in Section 5.

4.1.  SD-JWT and Disclosures

   An SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed JSON document
   containing digests over the selectively disclosable claims with the
   Disclosures outside the document.  Disclosures can be omitted without
   breaking the signature, and modifying them can be detected.
   Selectively disclosable claims can be individual object properties
   (name-value pairs) or array elements.

   Each digest value ensures the integrity of, and maps to, the
   respective Disclosure.  Digest values are calculated using a hash
   function over the Disclosures, each of which contains a
   cryptographically secure random salt, the claim name (only when the
   claim is an object property), and the claim value.  The Disclosures
   are sent to the Holder as part of the SD-JWT in the format defined in
   Section 5.  When presenting an SD-JWT to a Verifier, the Holder only
   includes the Disclosures for the claims that it wants to reveal to
   that Verifier.

   An SD-JWT MAY also contain clear-text claims that are always
   disclosed to the Verifier.

4.2.  Disclosing to a Verifier

   To disclose to a Verifier a subset of the SD-JWT claim values, a
   Holder sends only the Disclosures of those selectively released
   claims to the Verifier as part of the SD-JWT.

4.3.  Optional Key Binding

   Key Binding is an optional feature.  When Key Binding is required by
   the use-case, the SD-JWT MUST contain information about the key
   material controlled by the Holder.

   Note: How the public key is included in SD-JWT is out of scope of
   this document.  It can be passed by value or by reference.

   When a Verifier requires Key Binding, the Holder presents an SD-
   JWT+KB, consisting of an SD-JWT as well as a Key Binding JWT tied to
   that SD-JWT.  The Key Binding JWT encodes a signature by the Holder's
   private key over

   *  a hash of the SD-JWT,
   *  a nonce to ensure the freshness of the signature, and
   *  an audience value to indicate the intended audience for the
      document.

   Details of the format of Key Binding JWTs are described in
   Section 5.3.

4.4.  Verification

   At a high level, the Verifier

   *  receives either an SD-JWT or an SD-JWT+KB from the Holder,
   *  verifies the signature on the SD-JWT (or the the SD-JWT inside the
      SD-JWT+KB) using the Issuer's public key,
   *  verifies the signature on the KB-JWT using the public key included
      (or referenced) in the SD-JWT, if the Verifier's policy requires
      Key Binding, and
   *  calculates the digests over the Holder-Selected Disclosures and
      verifies that each digest is contained in the SD-JWT.

   The detailed algorithm is described in Section 8.3.

5.  SD-JWT and SD-JWT+KB Data Formats

   An SD-JWT is composed of

   *  an Issuer-signed JWT, and
   *  zero or more Disclosures.

   An SD-JWT+KB is composed of

   *  an SD-JWT, and
   *  a Key Binding JWT.

   The Issuer-signed JWT, Disclosures, and Key Binding JWT are explained
   in Section 5.1, Section 5.2, and Section 5.3 respectively.

   The serialized format for the SD-JWT is the concatenation of each
   part delineated with a single tilde ('~') character as follows:

   <Issuer-signed JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>~

   The order of the concatenated parts MUST be the Issuer-signed JWT, a
   tilde character, zero or more Disclosures each followed by a tilde
   character, and lastly the optional Key Binding JWT.  In the case that
   there is no Key Binding JWT, the last element MUST be an empty string
   and the last separating tilde character MUST NOT be omitted.

   The serialized format for an SD-JWT+KB extends the SD-JWT format by
   concatenating a Key Binding JWT.

<Issuer-signed JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>~<KB-JWT>

   The two formats can be distinguished by the final ~ character that is
   present on an SD-JWT.  A Verifier that expects an SD-JWT MUST verify
   that the final tilde-separated component is empty.  A Verifier that
   expects an SD-JWT+KB MUST verify that its final tilde-separated
   component is a valid KB-JWT.

   The Disclosures are linked to the Issuer-signed JWT through the
   digest values included therein.

   When issuing to a Holder, the Issuer includes all the relevant
   Disclosures in the SD-JWT.

   When presenting to a Verifier, the Holder sends only the selected set
   of the Disclosures in the SD-JWT.

   The Holder MAY send any subset of the Disclosures to the Verifier,
   i.e., none, some, or all Disclosures.  For data that the Holder does
   not want to reveal to the Verifier, the Holder MUST NOT send
   Disclosures or reveal the salt values in any other way.  A Holder
   MUST NOT send a Disclosure that was not included in the issued SD-JWT
   or send a Disclosure more than once.

   To further illustrate the SD-JWT format, the following example shows
   a few different SD-JWT permutations, both with and without various
   constituent parts.

   An SD-JWT without Disclosures and without a KB-JWT:
   <Issuer-signed JWT>~

   An SD-JWT with Disclosures and without a KB-JWT:
   <Issuer-signed JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure N>~

   An SD-JWT+KB without Disclosures:
   <Issuer-signed JWT>~<KB-JWT>

   An SD-JWT+KB with Disclosures:
   <Issuer-signed JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure N>~<KB-JWT>

5.1.  Issuer-signed JWT

   An SD-JWT has a JWT component that MUST be signed using the Issuer's
   private key.  It MUST NOT use the none algorithm.

   The payload of an SD-JWT is a JSON object according to the following
   rules:

   1.  The payload MAY contain the _sd_alg key described in
       Section 5.1.1.
   2.  The payload MAY contain one or more digests of Disclosures to
       enable selective disclosure of the respective claims, created and
       formatted as described in Section 5.2.
   3.  The payload MAY contain one or more decoy digests to obscure the
       actual number of claims in the SD-JWT, created and formatted as
       described in Section 5.2.5.
   4.  The payload MAY contain one or more non-selectively disclosable
       claims.
   5.  The payload MAY contain the Holder's public key(s) or
       reference(s) thereto, as explained in Section 5.1.2.
   6.  The payload MAY contain further claims such as iss, iat, etc. as
       defined or required by the application using SD-JWTs.
   7.  The payload MUST NOT contain the reserved claims _sd or ...
       except for the purpose of transporting digests as described
       below.

   The same digest value MUST NOT appear more than once in the SD-JWT.

   Applications of SD-JWT SHOULD be explicitly typed using the typ
   header parameter.  See Section 10.11 for more details.

   It is the Issuer who decides which claims are selectively disclosable
   and which are not.  End-User claims MAY be included as plaintext as
   well, e.g., if hiding the particular claims from the Verifier is not
   required in the intended use case.  See Section 10.7 for
   considerations on making validity-controlling claims such as exp
   selectively disclosable.

   Claims that are not selectively disclosable are included in the SD-
   JWT in plaintext just as they would be in any other JSON structure.

5.1.1.  Hash Function Claim

   The claim _sd_alg indicates the hash algorithm used by the Issuer to
   generate the digests as described in Section 5.2.  When used, this
   claim MUST appear at the top level of the SD-JWT payload.  It MUST
   NOT be used in any object nested within the payload.  If the _sd_alg
   claim is not present at the top level, a default value of sha-256
   MUST be used.

   The hash algorithm identifier MUST be a hash algorithm value from the
   "Hash Name String" column in the IANA "Named Information Hash
   Algorithm" registry [IANA.Hash.Algorithms] or a value defined in
   another specification and/or profile of this specification.

   To promote interoperability, implementations MUST support the sha-256
   hash algorithm.

   See Section 10 for requirements regarding entropy of the salt,
   minimum length of the salt, and choice of a hash algorithm.

5.1.2.  Key Binding

   If the Issuer wants to enable Key Binding, it includes a public key
   associated with the Holder, or a reference thereto, using the cnf
   claim as defined in [RFC7800].  The jwk confirmation method, as
   defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7800], is suggested for doing so,
   however, other confirmation methods can be used.

   Note that, as was stated in [RFC7800], if an application needs to
   represent multiple proof-of-possession keys in the same SD-JWT, one
   way to achieve this is to use other claim names, in addition to cnf,
   to hold the additional proof-of-possession key information.

   It is out of the scope of this document to describe how the Holder
   key pair is established.  For example, the Holder MAY create a key
   pair and provide a public key to the Issuer, the Issuer MAY create
   the key pair for the Holder, or Holder and Issuer MAY use pre-
   established key material.

   Note: The examples throughout this document use the cnf claim with
   the jwk member to include the raw public key by value in SD-JWT.

5.2.  Disclosures

   Disclosures are created differently depending on whether a claim is
   an object property (name-value pair) or an array element.

   *  For a claim that is an object property, the Issuer creates a
      Disclosure as described in Section 5.2.1.
   *  For a claim that is an array element, the Issuer creates a
      Disclosure as described in Section 5.2.2.

5.2.1.  Disclosures for Object Properties

   For each claim that is an object property and that is to be made
   selectively disclosable, the Issuer MUST create a Disclosure as
   follows:

   *  Create an array of three elements in this order:
      1.  A salt value.  MUST be a string.  See Section 10.3 for
          security considerations.  It is RECOMMENDED to base64url-
          encode minimum 128 bits of cryptographically secure random
          data, producing a string.  The salt value MUST be unique for
          each claim that is to be selectively disclosed.  The Issuer
          MUST NOT reveal the salt value to any party other than the
          Holder.
      2.  The claim name, or key, as it would be used in a regular JWT
          payload.  It MUST be a string and MUST NOT be _sd, ..., or a
          claim name existing in the object as a non-selectively
          disclosable claim.
      3.  The claim value, as it would be used in a regular JWT payload.
          The value MAY be of any type that is allowed in JSON,
          including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
   *  JSON-encode the array, producing an UTF-8 string.
   *  base64url-encode the byte representation of the UTF-8 string,
      producing a US-ASCII [RFC0020] string.  This string is the
      Disclosure.

   The order is decided based on the readability considerations: salts
   would have a constant length within the SD-JWT, claim names would be
   around the same length all the time, and claim values would vary in
   size, potentially being large objects.

   The following example illustrates the steps described above.

   The array is created as follows:

   ["_26bc4LT-ac6q2KI6cBW5es", "family_name", "Möbius"]

   The resulting Disclosure would be: WyJfMjZiYzRMVC1hYzZxMktJNmNCVzVlcy
   IsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNw7ZiaXVzIl0

   Note that variations in whitespace, encoding of Unicode characters,
   ordering of object properties, etc., are allowed in the JSON
   representation and no canonicalization needs be performed before
   base64url-encoding.  For example, the following strings are all valid
   and encode the same claim value "Möbius":

   *  A different way to encode the unicode umlaut:
      WyJfMjZiYzRMVC1hYzZxMktJNmNCVzVlcyIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNX
      HUwMGY2Yml1cyJd
   *  No white space:
      WyJfMjZiYzRMVC1hYzZxMktJNmNCVzVlcyIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIiwiTcO2Y
      ml1cyJd
   *  Newline characters between elements:
      WwoiXzI2YmM0TFQtYWM2cTJLSTZjQlc1ZXMiLAoiZmFtaWx5X25hbWUiLAoiT
      cO2Yml1cyIKXQ

   See Appendix B for some further considerations on the Disclosure
   format approach.

5.2.2.  Disclosures for Array Elements

   For each claim that is an array element and that is to be made
   selectively disclosable, the Issuer MUST create a Disclosure as
   follows:

   *  The array MUST contain two elements in this order:
      1.  The salt value as described in Section 5.2.1.
      2.  The array element that is to be hidden.  This value MAY be of
          any type that is allowed in JSON, including numbers, strings,
          booleans, arrays, and objects.

   The Disclosure string is created by JSON-encoding this array and
   base64url-encoding the byte representation of the resulting string as
   described in Section 5.2.1.  The same considerations regarding
   variations in the result of the JSON encoding apply.

   For example, a Disclosure for the second element of the nationalities
   array in the following claim set:

   {
     "nationalities": ["DE", "FR"]
   }

   could be created by first creating the following array:

   ["lklxF5jMYlGTPUovMNIvCA", "FR"]

   The resulting Disclosure would be:
   WyJsa2x4RjVqTVlsR1RQVW92TU5JdkNBIiwgIkZSIl0

5.2.3.  Hashing Disclosures

   For embedding references to the Disclosures in the SD-JWT, each
   Disclosure is hashed using the hash algorithm specified in the
   _sd_alg claim described in Section 5.1.1.  The resulting digest is
   then included in the SD-JWT payload instead of the original claim
   value, as described next.

   The digest MUST be taken over the US-ASCII bytes of the base64url-
   encoded value that is the Disclosure.  This follows the convention in
   JWS [RFC7515] and JWE [RFC7516].  The bytes of the digest MUST then
   be base64url-encoded.

   It is important to note that:

   *  The input to the hash function MUST be the base64url-encoded
      Disclosure, not the bytes encoded by the base64url string.
   *  The bytes of the output of the hash function MUST be base64url-
      encoded, and are not the bytes making up the (often used) hex
      representation of the bytes of the digest.

   For example, the SHA-256 digest of the Disclosure
   WyI2cU1RdlJMNWhhaiIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNw7ZiaXVzIl0 would be
   uutlBuYeMDyjLLTpf6Jxi7yNkEF35jdyWMn9U7b_RYY.

   The SHA-256 digest of the Disclosure
   WyJsa2x4RjVqTVlsR1RQVW92TU5JdkNBIiwgIkZSIl0 would be
   w0I8EKcdCtUPkGCNUrfwVp2xEgNjtoIDlOxc9-PlOhs.

5.2.4.  Embedding Disclosure Digests in SD-JWTs

   For selectively disclosable claims, the digests of the Disclosures
   are embedded into the Issuer-signed JWT instead of the claims
   themselves.  The precise way of embedding depends on whether a claim
   is an object property (name-value pair) or an array element.

   *  For a claim that is an object property, the Issuer embeds a
      Disclosure digest as described in Section 5.2.4.1.
   *  For a claim that is an array element, the Issuer creates a
      Disclosure digest as described in Section 5.2.4.2.

5.2.4.1.  Object Properties

   Digests of Disclosures for object properties are added to an array
   under the new key _sd in the object.  The _sd key MUST refer to an
   array of strings, each string being a digest of a Disclosure or a
   decoy digest as described in Section 5.2.5.

   The array MAY be empty in case the Issuer decided not to selectively
   disclose any of the claims at that level.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
   to omit the _sd key in this case to save space.

   The Issuer MUST hide the original order of the claims in the array.
   To ensure this, it is RECOMMENDED to shuffle the array of hashes,
   e.g., by sorting it alphanumerically or randomly, after potentially
   adding decoy digests as described in Section 5.2.5.  The precise
   method does not matter as long as it does not depend on the original
   order of elements.

   For example, using the digest of the object property Disclosure
   created above, the Issuer could create the following SD-JWT payload
   to make family_name selectively disclosable:

   {
     "given_name": "Alice",
     "_sd": ["uutlBuYeMDyjLLTpf6Jxi7yNkEF35jdyWMn9U7b_RYY"]
   }

5.2.4.2.  Array Elements

   Digests of Disclosures for array elements are added to the array in
   the same position as the original claim value in the array.  For each
   digest, an object of the form {"...": "<digest>"} is added to the
   array.  The key MUST always be the string ... (three dots).  The
   value MUST be the digest of the Disclosure created as described in
   Section 5.2.3.  There MUST NOT be any other keys in the object.

   For example, using the digest of the array element Disclosure created
   above, the Issuer could create the following SD-JWT payload to make
   the second element of the nationalities array selectively
   disclosable:

   {
     "nationalities":
       ["DE", {"...": "w0I8EKcdCtUPkGCNUrfwVp2xEgNjtoIDlOxc9-PlOhs"}]
   }

   As described in Section 8.3, Verifiers ignore all selectively
   disclosable array elements for which they did not receive a
   Disclosure.  In the example above, the verification process would
   output an array with only one element unless a matching Disclosure
   for the second element is received.

5.2.5.  Decoy Digests

   An Issuer MAY add additional digests to the SD-JWT payload that are
   not associated with any claim.  The purpose of such "decoy" digests
   is to make it more difficult for an attacker to see the original
   number of claims contained in the SD-JWT.  Decoy digests MAY be added
   both to the _sd array for objects as well as in arrays.

   It is RECOMMENDED to create the decoy digests by hashing over a
   cryptographically secure random number.  The bytes of the digest MUST
   then be base64url-encoded as above.  The same digest function as for
   the Disclosures MUST be used.

   For decoy digests, no Disclosure is sent to the Holder, i.e., the
   Holder will see digests that do not correspond to any Disclosure.
   See Section 11.3 for additional privacy considerations.

   To ensure readability and replicability, the examples in this
   specification do not contain decoy digests unless explicitly stated.
   For an example with decoy digests, see Appendix A.1.

5.3.  Key Binding JWT

   This section defines the Key Binding JWT, which encodes a signature
   over an SD-JWT by the Holder's private key.

   The Key Binding JWT MUST be a JWT according to [RFC7519] and its
   payload MUST contain the following elements:

   *  in the JOSE header,
      -  typ: REQUIRED.  MUST be kb+jwt, which explicitly types the Key
         Binding JWT as recommended in Section 3.11 of [RFC8725].
      -  alg: REQUIRED.  A digital signature algorithm identifier such
         as per IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms"
         registry.  MUST NOT be none.
   *  in the JWT payload,
      -  iat: REQUIRED.  The value of this claim MUST be the time at
         which the Key Binding JWT was issued using the syntax defined
         in [RFC7519].
      -  aud: REQUIRED.  The intended receiver of the Key Binding JWT.
         How the value is represented is up to the protocol used and out
         of scope of this specification.
      -  nonce: REQUIRED.  Ensures the freshness of the signature.  The
         value type of this claim MUST be a string.  How this value is
         obtained is up to the protocol used and out of scope of this
         specification.
      -  sd_hash: REQUIRED.  The base64url-encoded hash value over the
         Issuer-signed JWT and the selected Disclosures as defined
         below.

5.3.1.  Binding to an SD-JWT

   The hash value in the sd_hash claim binds the KB-JWT to the specific
   SD-JWT.  The sd_hash value MUST be taken over the US-ASCII bytes of
   the encoded SD-JWT, i.e., the Issuer-signed JWT, a tilde character,
   and zero or more Disclosures selected for presentation to the
   Verifier, each followed by a tilde character:

   <Issuer-signed JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>~

   The bytes of the digest MUST then be base64url-encoded.

   The same hash algorithm as for the Disclosures MUST be used (defined
   by the _sd_alg element in the Issuer-signed JWT or the default value,
   as defined in Section 5.1.1).

5.3.2.  Validating the Key Binding JWT

   The Verifier MUST ensure that the key with which it validates the
   signature on the Key Binding JWT is the key specified in the SD-JWT
   as the Holder's public key.  For example, if the SD-JWT contains a
   cnf value with a jwk member, the Verifier could parse the provided
   JWK and use it to verify the Key Binding JWT.

   Whether to require Key Binding is up to the Verifier's policy, based
   on the set of trust requirements such as trust frameworks it belongs
   to.  See Section 10.5 for security considerations.

6.  Example SD-JWT

   In this example, a simple SD-JWT is demonstrated.  This example is
   split into issuance and presentation.

   Note: Throughout the examples in this document, line breaks had to be
   added to JSON strings and base64-encoded strings to adhere to the
   72-character limit for lines in RFCs and for readability.  JSON does
   not allow line breaks within strings.

6.1.  Issuance

   The Issuer is using the following input claim set:

   {
     "sub": "user_42",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "phone_number_verified": true,
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
     "updated_at": 1570000000,
     "nationalities": [
       "US",
       "DE"
     ]
   }

   The Issuer in this case made the following decisions:

   *  The nationalities array is always visible, but its contents are
      selectively disclosable.
   *  The sub element and essential verification data (iss, iat, cnf,
      etc.) are always visible.
   *  All other End-User claims are selectively disclosable.
   *  For address, the Issuer is using a flat structure, i.e., all of
      the claims in the address claim can only be disclosed in full.
      Other options are discussed in Section 7.

   The following payload is used for the SD-JWT:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "CrQe7S5kqBAHt-nMYXgc6bdt2SH5aTY1sU_M-PgkjPI",
       "JzYjH4svliH0R3PyEMfeZu6Jt69u5qehZo7F7EPYlSE",

       "gbOsI4Edq2x2Kw-w5wPEzakob9hV1cRD0ATN3oQL9JM",
       "jsu9yVulwQQlhFlM_3JlzMaSFzglhQG0DpfayQwLUK4"
     ],
     "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "user_42",
     "nationalities": [
       {
         "...": "pFndjkZ_VCzmyTa6UjlZo3dh-ko8aIKQc9DlGzhaVYo"
       },
       {
         "...": "7Cf6JkPudry3lcbwHgeZ8khAv1U1OSlerP0VkBJrWZ0"
       }
     ],
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256",
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "P-256",

   The payload is then signed by the Issuer to create a JWT like the

6.2.  Presentation

   The following non-normative example shows an SD-JWT+KB as it would be
   sent from the Holder to the Verifier.  Note that it consists of six
   tilde-separated parts, with the Issuer-signed JWT as shown above in
   the beginning, four Disclosures (for the claims given_name,
   family_name, address, and nationalities) in the middle, and the Key
   Binding JWT as the last element.

   The following Key Binding JWT payload was created and signed for this
   presentation by the Holder:

   {
     "nonce": "1234567890",
     "aud": "https://verifier.example.org",
     "iat": 1718296423,
     "sd_hash": "gkUFhfvXjNh-7b4oUfBOq01UIgdT86qulbjdg4eXqeM"
   }

   If the Verifier did not require Key Binding, then the Holder could
   have presented the SD-JWT with selected Disclosures directly, instead
   of encapsulating it in an SD-JWT+KB.

7.  Considerations on Nested Data in SD-JWTs

   Being JSON, an object in an SD-JWT payload MAY contain name-value
   pairs where the value is another object or objects MAY be elements in
   arrays.  In SD-JWT, the Issuer decides for each claim individually,
   on each level of the JSON, whether the claim should be selectively
   disclosable or not.  This choice can be made on each level
   independent from whether keys higher in the hierarchy are selectively
   disclosable.

   From this it follows that the _sd key containing digests MAY appear
   multiple times in an SD-JWT, and likewise, there MAY be multiple
   arrays within the hierarchy with each having selectively disclosable
   elements.  Digests of selectively disclosable claims MAY even appear
   within other Disclosures.

   The following examples illustrate some of the options an Issuer has.
   It is up to the Issuer to decide which structure to use, depending
   on, for example, the expected use cases for the SD-JWT, requirements
   for privacy, size considerations, or ecosystem requirements.  For
   more examples with nested structures, see Appendix A.1 and
   Appendix A.2.

   The following input claim set is used as an example throughout this
   section:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta",
       "region": "Sachsen-Anhalt",
       "country": "DE"
     }
   }

   Important: The following examples of the structures are non-normative
   and are not intended to represent all possible options.  They are
   also not meant to define or restrict how address can be represented
   in an SD-JWT.

7.1.  Example: Flat SD-JWT

   The Issuer can decide to treat the address claim as a block that can
   either be disclosed completely or not at all.  The following example
   shows that in this case, the entire address claim is treated as an
   object in the Disclosure.

   {
     "_sd": [
       "fOBUSQvo46yQO-wRwXBcGqvnbKIueISEL961_Sjd4do"
     ],
     "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   The Issuer would create the following Disclosure:

   *Claim address*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: fOBUSQvo46yQO-wRwXBcGqvnbKIueISEL961_Sjd4do
   *  Disclosure:
      WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgImFkZHJlc3MiLCB7InN0cmVl
      dF9hZGRyZXNzIjogIlNjaHVsc3RyLiAxMiIsICJsb2NhbGl0eSI6ICJTY2h1
      bHBmb3J0YSIsICJyZWdpb24iOiAiU2FjaHNlbi1BbmhhbHQiLCAiY291bnRy
      eSI6ICJERSJ9XQ
   *  Contents: ["2GLC42sKQveCfGfryNRN9w", "address", {"street_address":
      "Schulstr. 12", "locality": "Schulpforta", "region":
      "Sachsen-Anhalt", "country": "DE"}]

7.2.  Example: Structured SD-JWT

   The Issuer may instead decide to make the address claim contents
   selectively disclosable individually:

   {
     "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "6vh9bq-zS4GKM_7GpggVbYzzu6oOGXrmNVGPHP75Ud0",
         "9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM",
         "KURDPh4ZC19-3tiz-Df39V8eidy1oV3a3H1Da2N0g88",
         "WN9r9dCBJ8HTCsS2jKASxTjEyW5m5x65_Z_2ro2jfXM"
       ]
     },
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   In this case, the Issuer would use the following data in the
   Disclosures for the address sub-claims:

   *Claim street_address*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: 9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM
   *  Disclosure:
      WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgInN0cmVldF9hZGRyZXNzIiwg
      IlNjaHVsc3RyLiAxMiJd
   *  Contents: ["2GLC42sKQveCfGfryNRN9w", "street_address", "Schulstr.
      12"]

   *Claim locality*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: 6vh9bq-zS4GKM_7GpggVbYzzu6oOGXrmNVGPHP75Ud0
   *  Disclosure:
      WyJlbHVWNU9nM2dTTklJOEVZbnN4QV9BIiwgImxvY2FsaXR5IiwgIlNjaHVs
      cGZvcnRhIl0
   *  Contents: ["eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A", "locality", "Schulpforta"]

   *Claim region*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: KURDPh4ZC19-3tiz-Df39V8eidy1oV3a3H1Da2N0g88
   *  Disclosure:
      WyI2SWo3dE0tYTVpVlBHYm9TNXRtdlZBIiwgInJlZ2lvbiIsICJTYWNoc2Vu
      LUFuaGFsdCJd
   *  Contents: ["6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA", "region", "Sachsen-Anhalt"]

   *Claim country*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: WN9r9dCBJ8HTCsS2jKASxTjEyW5m5x65_Z_2ro2jfXM
   *  Disclosure:
      WyJlSThaV205UW5LUHBOUGVOZW5IZGhRIiwgImNvdW50cnkiLCAiREUiXQ
   *  Contents: ["eI8ZWm9QnKPpNPeNenHdhQ", "country", "DE"]

   The Issuer may also make one sub-claim of address non-selectively
   disclosable and hide only the other sub-claims:

   {
     "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "6vh9bq-zS4GKM_7GpggVbYzzu6oOGXrmNVGPHP75Ud0",
         "9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM",
         "KURDPh4ZC19-3tiz-Df39V8eidy1oV3a3H1Da2N0g88"
       ],
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   In this case there would be no Disclosure for country since it is
   provided in the clear.

7.3.  Example: SD-JWT with Recursive Disclosures

   The Issuer may also decide to make the address claim contents
   selectively disclosable recursively, i.e., the address claim is made
   selectively disclosable as well as its sub-claims:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "HvrKX6fPV0v9K_yCVFBiLFHsMaxcD_114Em6VT8x1lg"
     ],
     "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "iat": 1683000000,
     "exp": 1883000000,
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "_sd_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   The Issuer creates Disclosures first for the sub-claims and then
   includes their digests in the Disclosure for the address claim:

   *Claim street_address*:

   *  SHA-256 Hash: 9gjVuXtdFROCgRrtNcGUXmF65rdezi_6Er_j76kmYyM
   *  Disclosure:
      WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgInN0cmVldF9hZGRyZXNzIiwg

8.  Verification and Processing

8.1.  Verification of the SD-JWT

   Upon receiving an SD-JWT, either directly or as a component of an SD-
   JWT+KB, a Holder or a Verifier needs to ensure that:

   *  the Issuer-signed JWT is valid, i.e., it is signed by the Issuer
      and the signature is valid, and
   *  all Disclosures are valid and correspond to a respective digest
      value in the Issuer-signed JWT (directly in the payload or
      recursively included in the contents of other Disclosures).

   The Holder or the Verifier MUST perform the following (or equivalent)
   steps when receiving an SD-JWT:

   1.  Separate the SD-JWT into the Issuer-signed JWT and the
       Disclosures (if any).
   2.  Validate the Issuer-signed JWT:
       1.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
           secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections 3.1
           and 3.2 for details.  The none algorithm MUST NOT be
           accepted.
       2.  Validate the signature over the Issuer-signed JWT per
           Section 5.2 of [RFC7515].
       3.  Validate the Issuer and that the signing key belongs to this
           Issuer.
       4.  Check that the _sd_alg claim value is understood and the hash
           algorithm is deemed secure (see Section 5.1.1).
   3.  Process the Disclosures and embedded digests in the Issuer-signed
       JWT as follows:
       1.  For each Disclosure provided:
           1.  Calculate the digest over the base64url-encoded string as
               described in Section 5.2.3.
       2.  (*) Identify all embedded digests in the Issuer-signed JWT as
           follows:
           1.  Find all objects having an _sd key that refers to an
               array of strings.
           2.  Find all array elements that are objects with one key,
               that key being ... and referring to a string.
       3.  (**) For each embedded digest found in the previous step:
           1.  Compare the value with the digests calculated previously
               and find the matching Disclosure.  If no such Disclosure
               can be found, the digest MUST be ignored.
           2.  If the digest was found in an object's _sd key:
               1.  If the contents of the respective Disclosure is not a
                   JSON-encoded array of three elements (salt, claim
                   name, claim value), the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.
               2.  If the claim name is _sd or ..., the SD-JWT MUST be
                   rejected.
               3.  If the claim name already exists at the level of the
                   _sd key, the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.
               4.  Insert, at the level of the _sd key, a new claim
                   using the claim name and claim value from the
                   Disclosure.
               5.  Recursively process the value using the steps
                   described in (*) and (**).
           3.  If the digest was found in an array element:
               1.  If the contents of the respective Disclosure is not a
                   JSON-encoded array of two elements (salt, value), the
                   SD-JWT MUST be rejected.
               2.  Replace the array element with the value from the
                   Disclosure.
               3.  Recursively process the value using the steps
                   described in (*) and (**).
       4.  Remove all array elements for which the digest was not found
           in the previous step.
       5.  Remove all _sd keys and their contents from the Issuer-signed
           JWT payload.  If this results in an object with no
           properties, it should be represented as an empty object {}.
       6.  Remove the claim _sd_alg from the SD-JWT payload.
   4.  If any digest value is encountered more than once in the Issuer-
       signed JWT payload (directly or recursively via other
       Disclosures), the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.
   5.  If any Disclosure was not referenced by digest value in the
       Issuer-signed JWT (directly or recursively via other
       Disclosures), the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.
   6.  Check that the SD-JWT is valid using claims such as nbf, iat, and
       exp in the processed payload.  If a required validity-controlling
       claim is missing (see Section 10.7), the SD-JWT MUST be rejected.

   If any step fails, the SD-JWT is not valid and processing MUST be
   aborted.

   It is up to the Holder how to maintain the mapping between the
   Disclosures and the plaintext claim values to be able to display them
   to the End-User when needed.

8.2.  Processing by the Holder

   The Issuer MUST provide the Holder an SD-JWT, not an SD-JWT+KB.  If
   the Holder receives an SD-JWT+KB, it SHOULD be rejected.

   For presentation to a Verifier, the Holder MUST perform the following
   (or equivalent) steps:

   1.  Decide which Disclosures to release to the Verifier, obtaining
       proper End-User consent if necessary.
   2.  Assemble the SD-JWT, including the Issuer-signed JWT and the
       selected Disclosures (see Section 5 for the format).
   3.  If Key Binding is not required:
       1.  Send the SD-JWT to the Verifier.
   4.  If Key Binding is required:
       1.  Create a Key Binding JWT tied to the SD-JWT.
       2.  Assemble the SD-JWT+KB by concatenating the SD-JWT and the
           Key Binding JWT.
       3.  Send the SD-JWT+KB to the Verifier.

8.3.  Verification by the Verifier

   Upon receiving a presentation from a Holder, in the form of either an
   SD-JWT or an SD-JWT+KB, in addition to the checks outlined in
   Section 8.1, Verifiers need to ensure that

   *  if Key Binding is required, then the Holder has provided an SD-
      JWT+KB, and
   *  the Key Binding JWT is signed by the Holder and valid.

   To this end, Verifiers MUST follow the following steps (or
   equivalent):

   1.  Determine if Key Binding is to be checked according to the
       Verifier's policy for the use case at hand.  This decision MUST
       NOT be based on whether a Key Binding JWT is provided by the
       Holder or not.  Refer to Section 10.5 for details.
   2.  If Key Binding is required and the Holder has provided an SD-JWT
       (without Key Binding), the Verifier MUST reject the presentation.
   3.  If the Holder has provided an SD-JWT+KB, parse it into an SD-JWT
       and a Key Binding JWT.
   4.  Process the SD-JWT as defined in Section 8.1.
   5.  If Key Binding is required:
       1.  Determine the public key for the Holder from the SD-JWT (see
           Section 5.1.2).
       2.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
           secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections 3.1
           and 3.2 for details.  The none algorithm MUST NOT be
           accepted.
       3.  Validate the signature over the Key Binding JWT per
           Section 5.2 of [RFC7515].
       4.  Check that the typ of the Key Binding JWT is kb+jwt (see
           Section 5.3).
       5.  Check that the creation time of the Key Binding JWT, as
           determined by the iat claim, is within an acceptable window.
       6.  Determine that the Key Binding JWT is bound to the current
           transaction and was created for this Verifier (replay
           protection) by validating nonce and aud claims.
       7.  Calculate the digest over the Issuer-signed JWT and
           Disclosures as defined in Section 5.3.1 and verify that it
           matches the value of the sd_hash claim in the Key Binding
           JWT.
       8.  Check that the Key Binding JWT is a valid JWT in all other
           respects, per [RFC7519] and [RFC8725].

   If any step fails, the presentation is not valid and processing MUST
   be aborted.

   Otherwise, the processed SD-JWT payload can be passed to the
   application to be used for the intended purpose.

9.  JWS JSON Serialization

   This section describes an alternative format for SD-JWT using the JWS
   JSON Serialization from [RFC7515].  Supporting this format is
   OPTIONAL.

9.1.  New Unprotected Header Parameters

   For both the General and Flattened JSON Serialization, the SD-JWT is
   represented as a JSON object according to Section 7.2 of [RFC7515].
   The following new unprotected header parameters are defined:

   *  disclosures: An array of strings where each element is an
      individual Disclosure as described in Section 5.2.
   *  kb_jwt: A Key Binding JWT as described in Section 5.3.

   If a Key Binding JWT is present, the digest in the sd_hash claim MUST
   be taken over a string built as described in Section 5.3.1.  The
   "Issuer-signed JWT" part is built by concatenating the protected
   header, the payload, and the signature of the JWS JSON serialized SD-
   JWT using a . character as a separator, and using the Disclosures
   from the disclosures member of the unprotected header.  In case of
   multiple signatures, only the first one is used for the Disclosures
   and Key Binding JWT.

9.2.  Flattened JSON Serialization

   In case of the Flattened JSON Serialization, there is only one
   unprotected header.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JWS JSON serialized SD-
   JWT as issued using the Flattened JSON Serialization:

   {
     "header": {
       "disclosures": [
         "WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgInN1YiIsICJqb2huX2RvZV80M

       1nNSTzfzmhv3tvm7wDczs4efP6tEXDCalg"
   }

9.3.  General JSON Serialization

   In case of the General JSON Serialization, there are multiple
   unprotected headers (one per signature).  If present, disclosures and
   kb_jwt, MUST be included in the first unprotected header and MUST NOT
   be present in any following unprotected headers.

   The following is a non-normative example of a presentation of a JWS
   JSON serialized SD-JWT including a Key Binding JWT using the General
   JSON Serialization:

   {
     "payload": "eyJfc2QiOiBbIjRIQm42YUlZM1d0dUdHV1R4LXFVajZjZGs2V0JwWn

       }
     ]
   }

9.4.  Verification of the JWS JSON Serialized SD-JWT

   Verification of the JWS JSON serialized SD-JWT follows the rules
   defined in Section 4.4, except for the following aspects:

   *  The SD-JWT does not need to be split into component parts and the
      Disclosures can be found in the disclosures member of the
      unprotected header.
   *  To verify the digest in sd_hash in the Key Binding JWT, the
      Verifier MUST assemble the string to be hashed as described in
      Section 9.1.

10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in this section help achieve the following
   properties:

   *Selective Disclosure:* An adversary in the role of the Verifier
   cannot obtain information from an SD-JWT about any claim name or
   claim value that was not explicitly disclosed by the Holder unless
   that information can be derived from other disclosed claims or
   sources other than the presented SD-JWT.

   *Integrity:* A malicious Holder cannot modify names or values of
   selectively disclosable claims without detection by the Verifier.

   Additionally, as described in Section 10.5, the application of Key
   Binding can ensure that the presenter of an SD-JWT credential is the
   legitimate Holder of the credential.

10.1.  Mandatory Signing of the Issuer-signed JWT

   The Issuer-signed JWT MUST be signed by the Issuer to protect
   integrity of the issued claims.  An attacker can modify or add claims
   if this JWT is not signed (e.g., change the "email" attribute to take
   over the victim's account or add an attribute indicating a fake
   academic qualification).

   The Verifier MUST always check the signature of the Issuer-signed JWT
   to ensure that it has not been tampered with since the issuance.  The
   Issuer-signed JWT MUST be rejected if the signature cannot be
   verified.

   The security of the Issuer-signed JWT depends on the security of the
   signature algorithm.  Any of the JWS asymmetric digital signature
   algorithms registered in [IANA.JWS.Algorithms] can be used, including
   post-quantum algorithms, when they are ready.

10.2.  Manipulation of Disclosures

   Holders can manipulate the Disclosures by changing the values of the
   claims before sending them to the Verifier.  The Verifier MUST check
   the Disclosures to ensure that the values of the claims are correct,
   i.e., the digests of the Disclosures are actually present in the
   signed SD-JWT.

   A naive Verifier that extracts all claim values from the Disclosures
   (without checking the hashes) and inserts them into the SD-JWT
   payload is vulnerable to this attack.  However, in a structured SD-
   JWT, without comparing the digests of the Disclosures, such an
   implementation could not determine the correct place in a nested
   object where a claim needs to be inserted.  Therefore, the naive
   implementation would not only be insecure, but also incorrect.

   The steps described in Section 8.3 ensure that the Verifier checks
   the Disclosures correctly.

10.3.  Entropy of the salt

   The security model that conceals the plaintext claims relies on the
   high entropy random data of the salt as additional input to the hash
   function.  The randomness ensures that the same plaintext claim value
   does not produce the same digest value.  It also makes it infeasible
   to guess the preimage of the digest (thereby learning the plaintext
   claim value) by enumerating the potential value space for a claim
   into the hash function to search for a matching digest value.  It is
   therefore vitally important that unrevealed salts cannot be learned
   or guessed, even if other salts have been revealed.  As such, each
   salt MUST be created in such a manner that it is cryptographically
   random, sufficiently long, and has high enough entropy that it is
   infeasible to guess.  A new salt MUST be chosen for each claim
   independently of other salts.  See Randomness Requirements for
   Security [RFC4086] for considerations on generating random values.

   The RECOMMENDED minimum length of the randomly-generated portion of
   the salt is 128 bits.

   The Issuer MUST ensure that a new salt value is chosen for each
   claim, including when the same claim name occurs at different places
   in the structure of the SD-JWT.  This can be seen in the example in
   Appendix A.2, where multiple claims with the name type appear, but
   each of them has a different salt.

10.4.  Choice of a Hash Algorithm

   To ensure privacy of claims that are selectively disclosable, but are
   not being disclosed in a given presentation, the hash function MUST
   ensure that it is infeasible to calculate any portion of the three
   elements (salt, claim name, claim value) from a particular digest.
   This implies the hash function MUST be preimage resistant, but should
   also not allow an observer to infer any partial information about the
   undisclosed content.  In the terminology of cryptographic commitment
   schemes, the hash function MUST be computationally hiding.

   To ensure the integrity of selectively disclosable claims, the hash
   function MUST be second-preimage resistant.  That is, for any
   combination of salt, claim name and claim value, it is infeasible to
   find a different combination of salt, claim name and claim value that
   result in the same digest.

   The hash function SHOULD also be collision resistant.  Although not
   essential to the anticipated uses of SD-JWT, without collision
   resistance an Issuer may be able to find multiple disclosures that
   have the same hash value.  In which case, the signature over the SD-
   JWT would not then commit the Issuer to the contents of the JWT.  The
   collision resistance of the hash function used to generate digests
   SHOULD match the collision resistance of the hash function used by
   the signature scheme.  For example, use of the ES512 signature
   algorithm would require a disclosure hash function with at least
   256-bit collision resistance, such as SHA-512.

   Note that inclusion in the "Named Information Hash Algorithm"
   registry [IANA.Hash.Algorithms] alone does not indicate a hash
   algorithm's suitability for use in SD-JWT (it contains several
   heavily truncated digests, such as sha-256-32 and sha-256-64, which
   are unfit for security applications).

   Furthermore, the hash algorithms MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA-1 revealed
   fundamental weaknesses and MUST NOT be used.

10.5.  Key Binding

   Key Binding aims to ensure that the presenter of an SD-JWT credential
   is actually the legitimate Holder of the credential.  An SD-JWT
   compatible with Key Binding contains a public key, or a reference to
   a public key, that corresponds to a private key possessed by the
   Holder.  The Verifier requires that the Holder prove possession of
   that private key when presenting the SD-JWT credential.

   Without Key Binding, a Verifier only gets the proof that the
   credential was issued by a particular Issuer, but the credential
   itself can be replayed by anyone who gets access to it.  This means
   that, for example, after a credential was leaked to an attacker, the
   attacker can present the credential to any verifier that does not
   require a binding.  But also a malicious Verifier to which the Holder
   presented the credential can present the credential to another
   Verifier if that other Verifier does not require Key Binding.

   Verifiers MUST decide whether Key Binding is required for a
   particular use case before verifying a credential.  This decision can
   be informed by various factors including, but not limited to the
   following: business requirements, the use case, the type of binding
   between a Holder and its credential that is required for a use case,
   the sensitivity of the use case, the expected properties of a
   credential, the type and contents of other credentials expected to be
   presented at the same time, etc.

   It is important that a Verifier does not make its security policy
   decisions based on data that can be influenced by an attacker.  For
   this reason, when deciding whether Key Binding is required or not,
   Verifiers MUST NOT take into account whether the Holder has provided
   an SD-JWT+KB or a bare SD-JWT, since otherwise an attacker could
   strip the KB-JWT from an SD-JWT+KB and present the resulting SD-JWT.

   Furthermore, Verifiers should be aware that Key Binding information
   may have been added to an SD-JWT in a format that they do not
   recognize and therefore may not be able to tell whether the SD-JWT
   supports Key Binding or not.

   If a Verifier determines that Key Binding is required for a
   particular use case and the Holder presents either a bare SD-JWT or
   an SD-JWT+KB with an invalid Key Binding JWT, then the Verifier will
   reject the presentation when following the verification steps
   described in Section 8.3.

10.6.  Blinding Claim Names

   SD-JWT ensures that names of claims that are selectively disclosable
   are always blinded.  This prevents an attacker from learning the
   names of the disclosable claims.  However, the names of the claims
   that are not disclosable are not blinded.  This includes the keys of
   objects that themselves are not blinded, but contain disclosable
   claims.  This limitation needs to be taken into account by Issuers
   when creating the structure of the SD-JWT.

10.7.  Selectively-Disclosable Validity Claims

   An Issuer MUST NOT allow any content to be selectively disclosable
   that is critical for evaluating the SD-JWT's authenticity or
   validity.  The exact list of such content will depend on the
   application and SHOULD be listed by any application-specific profile
   of SD-JWT.  The following is a list of registered JWT claim names
   that SHOULD be considered as security-critical:

   *  iss (Issuer)
   *  aud (Audience), although issuers MAY allow individual entries in
      the array to be selectively disclosable
   *  exp (Expiration Time)
   *  nbf (Not Before)
   *  cnf (Confirmation Key)

   Issuers will typically include claims controlling the validity of the
   SD-JWT in plaintext in the SD-JWT payload, but there is no guarantee
   they would do so.  Therefore, Verifiers cannot reliably depend on
   that and need to operate as though security-critical claims might be
   selectively disclosable.

   Verifiers therefore MUST ensure that all claims they deem necessary
   for checking the validity of an SD-JWT in the given context are
   present (or disclosed, respectively) during validation of the SD-JWT.
   This is implemented in the last step of the verification defined in
   Section 8.1.

   The precise set of required validity claims will typically be defined
   by ecosystem rules, application-specific profile, or the credential
   format and MAY include claims other than those listed herein.

10.8.  Issuer Signature Key Distribution and Rotation

   This specification does not define how signature verification keys of
   Issuers are distributed to Verifiers.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
   that Issuers publish their keys in a way that allows for efficient
   and secure key rotation and revocation, for example, by publishing
   keys at a predefined location using the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)
   format [RFC7517].  Verifiers need to ensure that they are not using
   expired or revoked keys for signature verification using reasonable
   and appropriate means for the given key-distribution method.

10.9.  Forwarding Credentials

   Any entity in possession of an SD-JWT (including an SD-JWT extracted
   from an SD-JWT+KB) can forward it to any third party that does not
   enforce Key Binding.  When doing so, that entity may remove
   Disclosures such that the receiver learns only a subset of the claims
   contained in the original SD-JWT.

   For example, a device manufacturer might produce an SD-JWT containing
   information about upstream and downstream supply chain contributors.
   Each supply chain party can verify only the claims that were
   selectively disclosed to them by an upstream party, and they can
   choose to further reduce the disclosed claims when presenting to a
   downstream party.

   In some scenarios this behavior could be desirable, but if it is not,
   Issuers need to support and Verifiers need to enforce Key Binding.

10.10.  Integrity of SD-JWTs and SD-JWT+KBs

   With an SD-JWT, the Issuer-signed JWT is integrity-protected by the
   Issuer's signature, and the values of the Disclosures are integrity-
   protected by the digests included therein.  The specific set of
   Disclosures, however, is not integrity-protected - the SD-JWT can be
   modified by adding or removing Disclosures and still be valid.

   With an SD-JWT+KB, the set of selected Disclosures is integrity-
   protected.  The signature in the Key Binding JWT covers a specific
   SD-JWT, with a specific Issuer-signed JWT and a specific set of
   Disclosures.  Thus, the signature on the Key Binding JWT, in addition
   to proving Key Binding, also assures the authenticity and integrity
   of the set of Disclosures the Holder disclosed.  The set of
   Disclosures in an SD-JWT+KB is the set that the Holder intended to
   send; no intermediate party has added, removed, or modified the list
   of Disclosures.

10.11.  Explicit Typing

   Section 3.11 of [RFC8725] describes the use of explicit typing to
   prevent confusion attacks in which one kind of JWT is mistaken for
   another.  SD-JWTs are also potentially vulnerable to such confusion
   attacks, so it is RECOMMENDED to specify an explicit type by
   including the typ header parameter when the SD-JWT is issued, and for
   Verifiers to check this value.

   When explicit typing is employed for an SD-JWT, it is RECOMMENDED
   that a media type name of the format "application/example+sd-jwt" be
   used, where "example" is replaced by the identifier for the specific
   kind of SD-JWT.  The definition of typ in Section 4.1.9 of [RFC7515]
   recommends that the "application/" prefix be omitted, so "example+sd-
   jwt" would be the value of the typ header parameter.

11.  Privacy Considerations

   The privacy principles of [ISO.29100] should be adhered to.

11.1.  Storage of Signed User Data

   Wherever End-User data is stored, it represents a potential target
   for an attacker.  This target can be of particularly high value when
   the data is signed by a trusted authority like an official national
   identity service.  For example, in OpenID Connect, signed ID Tokens
   can be stored by Relying Parties.  In the case of SD-JWT, Holders
   have to store SD-JWTs, and Issuers and Verifiers may decide to do so
   as well.

   Not surprisingly, a leak of such data risks revealing private data of
   End-Users to third parties.  Signed End-User data, the authenticity
   of which can be easily verified by third parties, further exacerbates
   the risk.  As discussed in Section 10.5, leaked SD-JWTs may also
   allow attackers to impersonate Holders unless Key Binding is enforced
   and the attacker does not have access to the Holder's cryptographic
   keys.  Altogether, leaked SD-JWT credentials may have a high monetary
   value on black markets.

   Due to these risks, systems implementing SD-JWT SHOULD be designed to
   minimize the amount of data that is stored.  All involved parties
   SHOULD store SD-JWTs containing privacy-sensitive data only for as
   long as needed, including in log files.

   After Issuance, Issuers SHOULD NOT store the Issuer-signed JWT or the
   respective Disclosures if they contain privacy-sensitive data.

   Holders SHOULD store SD-JWTs only in encrypted form, and, wherever
   possible, use hardware-backed encryption in particular for the
   private Key Binding key.  Decentralized storage of data, e.g., on
   End-User devices, SHOULD be preferred for End-User credentials over
   centralized storage.  Expired SD-JWTs SHOULD be deleted as soon as
   possible.

   After Verification, Verifiers SHOULD NOT store the Issuer-signed JWT
   or the respective Disclosures if they contain privacy-sensitive data.
   It may be sufficient to store the result of the verification and any
   End-User data that is needed for the application.

   If reliable and secure key rotation and revocation is ensured
   according to Section 10.8, Issuers may opt to publish expired or
   revoked private signing keys (after a grace period that ensures that
   the keys are not cached any longer at any Verifier).  This reduces
   the value of any leaked credentials as the signatures on them can no
   longer be trusted to originate from the Issuer.

11.2.  Confidentiality during Transport

   If the SD-JWT is transmitted over an insecure channel during issuance
   or presentation, an adversary may be able to intercept and read the
   End-User's personal data or correlate the information with previous
   uses of the same SD-JWT.

   Usually, transport protocols for issuance and presentation of
   credentials are designed to protect the confidentiality of the
   transmitted data, for example, by requiring the use of TLS.

   This specification therefore considers the confidentiality of the
   data to be provided by the transport protocol and does not specify
   any encryption mechanism.

   Implementers MUST ensure that the transport protocol provides
   confidentiality if the privacy of End-User data or correlation
   attacks by passive observers are a concern.

   To encrypt the SD-JWT when transmitted over an insecure channel,
   implementers MAY use JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516] by nesting
   the SD-JWT as the plaintext payload of a JWE.  Especially, when an
   SD-JWT is transmitted via a URL and information may be stored/cached
   in the browser or end up in web server logs, the SD-JWT SHOULD be
   encrypted using JWE.

11.3.  Decoy Digests

   The use of decoy digests is RECOMMENDED when the number of claims (or
   the existence of particular claims) can be a side-channel disclosing
   information about otherwise undisclosed claims.  In particular, if a
   claim in an SD-JWT is present only if a certain condition is met
   (e.g., a membership number is only contained if the End-User is a
   member of a group), the Issuer SHOULD add decoy digests when the
   condition is not met.

   Decoy digests increase the size of the SD-JWT.  The number of decoy
   digests (or whether to use them at all) is a trade-off between the
   size of the SD-JWT and the privacy of the End-User's data.

11.4.  Unlinkability

   Unlinkability is a property whereby adversaries are prevented from
   correlating credential presentations of the same user beyond the
   user's consent.  Without unlinkability, an adversary might be able to
   learn more about the user than the user intended to disclose, for
   example:

   *  Cooperating Verifiers might want to track users across services to
      build advertising profiles.
   *  Issuers might want to track where users present their credentials
      to enable surveillance.
   *  After a data breach at multiple Verifiers, publicly available
      information might allow linking identifiable information presented
      to Verifier A with originally anonymous information presented to
      Verifier B, therefore revealing the identities of users of
      Verifier B.

   The following types of unlinkability are considered here:

   *  Presentation Unlinkability: A Verifier should not be able to link
      two presentations of the same credential.
   *  Verifier/Verifier Unlinkability: Two colluding Verifiers should
      not be able to learn that they have received presentations of the
      same credential.
   *  Issuer/Verifier Unlinkability (Honest Verifier): An Issuer of a
      credential should not be able to know that a user presented the
      credential to a certain Verifier that is not behaving maliciously.
   *  Issuer/Verifier Unlinkability (Colluding/Compromised Verifier): An
      Issuer of a credential should not be able to tell that a user
      presented the credential to a certain Verifier, even if the
      Verifier colludes with the Issuer or becomes compromised and leaks
      stored credentials from presentations.

   In all cases, unlinkability is limited to cases where the disclosed
   claims do not contain information that directly or indirectly
   identifies the user.  For example, when a taxpayer identification
   number is contained in the disclosed claims, the Issuer and Verifier
   can easily link the user's transactions.  However, when the user only
   discloses a birthdate to one Verifier and a postal code to another
   Verifier, the two Verifiers should not be able to determine that they
   were interacting with the same user.

   Issuer/Verifier unlinkability with a colluding or compromised
   Verifier cannot be achieved in salted-hash based selective disclosure
   approaches, such as SD-JWT, as the issued credential with the
   Issuer's signature is directly presented to the Verifier, who can
   forward it to the Issuer.

   Contrary to that, Issuer/Verifier unlinkability with an honest
   Verifier can generally be achieved.  However, a callback from the
   Verifier to the Issuer, such as a revocation check, could potentially
   disclose information about the credential's usage to the Issuer.
   Where such callbacks are necessary, they MUST be executed in a manner
   that preserves privacy and does not disclose details about the
   credential to the Issuer.  It is important to note that the timing of
   such requests could potentially serve as a side-channel.

   Verifier/Verifier unlinkablility and presentation unlinkablility can
   be achieved using batch issuance: A batch of credentials based on the
   same claims is issued to the Holder instead of just a single
   credential.  The Holder can then use a different credential for each
   Verifier or even for each session with a Verifier.  New key binding
   keys and salts MUST be used for each credential in the batch to
   ensure that the Verifiers cannot link the credentials using these
   values.  Likewise, claims carrying time information, like iat, exp,
   and nbf, MUST either be randomized within a time period considered
   appropriate (e.g., randomize iat within the last 24 hours and
   calculate exp accordingly) or rounded (e.g., rounded down to the
   beginning of the day).

11.5.  Issuer Identifier

   An Issuer issuing only one type of SD-JWT might have privacy
   implications, because if the Holder has an SD-JWT issued by that
   Issuer, its type and claim names can be determined.

   For example, if the National Cancer Institute only issued SD-JWTs
   with cancer registry information, it is possible to deduce that the
   Holder owning its SD-JWT is a cancer patient.

   Moreover, the issuer identifier alone may reveal information about
   the user.

   For example, when a military organization or a drug rehabilitation
   center issues a vaccine credential, verifiers can deduce that the
   holder is a military member or may have a substance use disorder.

   To mitigate this issue, a group of issuers may elect to use a common
   Issuer identifier.  A group signature scheme outside the scope of
   this specification may also be used, instead of an individual
   signature.

Appendix A.  Additional Examples

   Important: The following examples are not normative and are provided
   for illustrative purposes only.  In particular, neither the structure
   of the claims nor the selection of selectively disclosable claims is
   normative.

   Line breaks have been added for readability.

A.1.  Simple Structured SD-JWT

   In this example, in contrast to Section 6, the Issuer decided to
   create a structured object for the address claim, allowing to
   separately disclose individual members of the claim.

   The Issuer is using the following input claim set:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "given_name": "太郎",
     "family_name": "山田",
     "email": "\"unusual email address\"@example.jp",
     "phone_number": "+81-80-1234-5678",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "東京都港区芝公園４丁目２−８",
       "locality": "東京都",
       "region": "港区",
       "country": "JP"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
   }

   The Issuer also decided to add decoy digests to prevent the Verifier
   from deducing the true number of claims.

   The following payload is used for the SD-JWT:

     "_sd": [
       "C9inp6YoRaEXR427zYJP7Qrk1WH_8bdwOA_YUrUnGQU",

A.3.  SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC)

   This example shows how the artifacts defined in this specification
   could be used in the context of SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials
   (SD-JWT VC) [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] to represent the concept of a
   Person Identification Data (PID) [EUDIW.ARF] using the data of a
   German citizen.

   Key Binding is applied using the Holder's public key passed in a cnf
   claim in the SD-JWT.

   The Issuer is using the following input claim set:

   {
     "vct": "https://bmi.bund.example/credential/pid/1.0",
     "given_name": "Erika",
     "family_name": "Mustermann",
     "birthdate": "1963-08-12",
     "source_document_type": "id_card",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Heidestraße 17",
       "locality": "Köln",
       "postal_code": "51147",
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "nationalities": [
       "DE"
     ],
     "gender": "female",
     "birth_family_name": "Gabler",
     "place_of_birth": {
       "locality": "Berlin",
       "country": "DE"
     },
     "also_known_as": "Schwester Agnes",
     "age_equal_or_over": {
       "12": true,
       "14": true,
       "16": true,
       "18": true,
       "21": true,

A.5.  Elliptic Curve Key Used in the Examples

   The following Elliptic Curve public key, represented in JWK format,
   can be used to validate the Issuer signatures in the above examples:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "b28d4MwZMjw8-00CG4xfnn9SLMVMM19SlqZpVb_uNtQ",
     "y": "Xv5zWwuoaTgdS6hV43yI6gBwTnjukmFQQnJ_kCxzqk8"
   }

   The public key used to validate a Key Binding JWT can be found in the
   examples as the content of the cnf claim.

Appendix B.  Disclosure Format Considerations

   As described in Section 5.2, the Disclosure structure is JSON
   containing salt and the cleartext content of a claim, which is
   base64url encoded.  The encoded value is the input used to calculate
   a digest for the respective claim.  The inclusion of digest value in
   the signed JWT ensures the integrity of the claim value.  Using
   encoded content as the input to the integrity mechanism is
   conceptually similar to the approach in JWS and particularly useful
   when the content, like JSON, can have differences but be semantically
   equivalent.  Some further discussion of the considerations around
   this design decision follows.

   When receiving an SD-JWT, a Verifier must be able to re-compute
   digests of the disclosed claim values and, given the same input
   values, obtain the same digest values as signed by the Issuer.

   Usually, JSON-based formats transport claim values as simple
   properties of a JSON object such as this:

   ...
     "family_name": "Möbius",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta"
     }
   ...

   However, a problem arises when computation over the data need to be
   performed and verified, like signing or computing digests.  Common
   signature schemes require the same byte string as input to the
   signature verification as was used for creating the signature.  In
   the digest approach outlined above, the same problem exists: for the
   Issuer and the Verifier to arrive at the same digest, the same byte
   string must be hashed.

   JSON, however, does not prescribe a unique encoding for data, but
   allows for variations in the encoded string.  The data above, for
   example, can be encoded as

   ...
   "family_name": "M\u00f6bius",
   "address": {
     "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
     "locality": "Schulpforta"
   }
   ...

   or as

  ...
  "family_name": "Möbius",
  "address": {"locality":"Schulpforta", "street_address":"Schulstr. 12"}
  ...

   The two representations of the value in family_name are very
   different on the byte-level, but yield equivalent objects.  Same for
   the representations of address, varying in white space and order of
   elements in the object.

   The variations in white space, ordering of object properties, and
   encoding of Unicode characters are all allowed by the JSON
   specification, including further variations, e.g., concerning
   floating-point numbers, as described in [RFC8785].  Variations can be
   introduced whenever JSON data is serialized or deserialized and
   unless dealt with, will lead to different digests and the inability
   to verify signatures.

   There are generally two approaches to deal with this problem:

   1.  Canonicalization: The data is transferred in JSON format,
       potentially introducing variations in its representation, but is
       transformed into a canonical form before computing a digest.
       Both the Issuer and the Verifier must use the same
       canonicalization algorithm to arrive at the same byte string for
       computing a digest.
   2.  Source string hardening: Instead of transferring data in a format
       that may introduce variations, a representation of the data is
       serialized.  This representation is then used as the hashing
       input at the Verifier, but also transferred to the Verifier and
       used for the same digest calculation there.  This means that the
       Verifier can easily compute and check the digest of the byte
       string before finally deserializing and accessing the data.

   Mixed approaches are conceivable, i.e., transferring both the
   original JSON data plus a string suitable for computing a digest, but
   such approaches can easily lead to undetected inconsistencies
   resulting in time-of-check-time-of-use type security vulnerabilities.

   In this specification, the source string hardening approach is used,
   as it allows for simple and reliable interoperability without the
   requirement for a canonicalization library.  To harden the source
   string, any serialization format that supports the necessary data
   types could be used in theory, like protobuf, msgpack, or pickle.  In
   this specification, JSON is used and plaintext contents of each
   Disclosure are encoded using base64url-encoding for transport.  This
   approach means that SD-JWTs can be implemented purely based on widely
   available JWT, JSON, and Base64 encoding and decoding libraries.

   A Verifier can then easily check the digest over the source string
   before extracting the original JSON data.  Variations in the encoding
   of the source string are implicitly tolerated by the Verifier, as the
   digest is computed over a predefined byte string and not over a JSON
   object.

   It is important to note that the Disclosures are neither intended nor
   suitable for direct consumption by an application that needs to
   access the disclosed claim values after the verification by the
   Verifier.  The Disclosures are only intended to be used by a Verifier
   to check the digests over the source strings and to extract the
   original JSON data.  The original JSON data is then used by the
   application.  See Section 8.3 for details.

   *  Disclosures are now delivered not as a JWT but as separate
      base64url-encoded JSON objects.
   *  In the SD-JWT, digests are collected under a _sd claim per level.
   *  Terms "II-Disclosures" and "HS-Disclosures" are replaced with
      "Disclosures".
   *  Holder Binding is now separate from delivering the Disclosures and
      implemented, if required, with a separate JWT.

      inlined.
   *  Updated and automated the W3C VC example.
   *  Added examples with multibyte characters to show that the
      specification and demo code work well with UTF-8.
   *  reverted back to hash alg from digest derivation alg (renamed to
      _sd_alg)
   *  reformatted

   -01

   *  introduced blinded claim names
   *  explained why JSON-encoding of values is needed

   *  clarified relationship between sd_hs_disclosure and SD-JWT
   *  clarified combined formats for issuance and presentation
   *  clarified security requirements for blinded claim names
