(Something the use-cases still need to clarify is the fact that the issuer is known. Still waiting for some additional feedback.)\r\n\r\n--\r\nThat's what I thought. Another question would be: For structured claim objects (cf. eKYC & IDA Spec), do we need to hide the structure? The structure itself might be revealing some information.\r\n--\r\nI can imagine the cases where an issuer would be issuing only one type of credentials with fixed structure and claimset. That means, if you know the issuer, you can pretty much find out the structure and claim names in it. So, hiding the structure and claim names would not add much.\r\n--\r\nI would assume that is the default.\r\n--\r\nI agree\r\n--\r\nIn ekyc, the structure alone can reveal the type of evidence used, which might leak info about e.g. nationality. \r\n\r\nBut these cases might be rare and I'd also like to keep it simple for now.\r\n--\r\nRight. At the same time, you typically want to know the nationality in the case of EKYC in financial institutions :-) \r\n\r\nSpeaking of that, I was assuming that in a lot of cases, the receiver may need to know the type of credential especially when the issuer was issuing multiple types of credentials at different assurance levels. Is this assumption bogus?\r\n--\r\nThat's a valid assumption. Verifier needs to know the level of assurance of the VC and in most cases (I guess) it will need to know under what policies the holder keys are created/stored/... (or if it can trust the wallet where the Verifiable Presentation was created and is shared from)\r\n--\r\n",

But there are some limitations because mobile OS native mechanisms allow to register multiple biometrics for the same device.\r\n- another option would be to include a portrait image as a claim in SD-JWT, holder app would compare it against a live image of the user, but will not release an SD-JWT claim in SD-JWT-R.\r\n\r\nre transaction-binding, in the case of JWT-VCs, VP is bound to the transaction because it includes nonce and audience from the presentation request.

I worry that the hash check https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-fett-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-00.html#section-5-3.5.2.2.2.2.1 is the kind of protocol design thing that makes it easy for developer mistakes to arise (not exactly like alg=none but similar) that allow signature bypass. Encrypted values in the SD-JWT payload would make that particular mistake impossible. There are tradeoffs, of course. Size being one but maybe not too different overall. But the hash check feels like a potential \"foot gun\" that could be avoided.",

I am not proposing an encryption based selective disclosure scheme, but rather that the SVC should be protected so that only the holder can access it.\r\n\r\nIn the current proposal, the SVC is handed to the holder in cleartext as a separate artefact along with the SD-JWT. The holder then calculates the SD-JWT-R and presents two artefacts to the verifier, namely the SD-JWT and the SD-JWT-R. \r\n\r\nFor what I have in mind, the holder would still follow the same steps as in the current proposal, with the extra step of decrypting the SVC information whenever they need to calculate the SD-JWT-R, but without the hassle of having to maintain two separate artefacts.\r\n\r\nWhen encrypting the SVC, it is done using the holder public key. This protects against accidental leakage if the SVC ends up in log files or get exfiltrated somehow (privacy preserving by default). Since the SVC is now private to the holder, it can be included in the SD-JWT as an attribute, so no need to send two artefacts, you can just send one. Whenever the holder wants to perform selective disclosure, they decrypt the SVC information (which is now included in the SD-JWT), calculate the SD-JWT-R, and then present the SD-JWT and SD-JWT-R to the verifier as before. Even though the SD-JWT includes the SVC information, the verifier cannot do anything with it since it is encrypted and only the holder can decrypt it. ",

Which eliminates the possibility of relying on the claim values from the SVC while forgetting to to do the integrity check. And yes, as you point out, that check is fundamental. But mistakes like that do happen and have happened. And, so to the extent possible/reasonable, it's good if the protocol design can eliminate or reduce the possibility of making common mistakes.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed approach, the SD-JWT is bigger. And the disclosure container will be smaller than the SVC.\r\n\r\nIt could be something different but I used plain JWE for the encrypted values. Which has the benefit of reusing the JWE spec and concepts. And should mean that JWE libraries already have the code to process the stuff. So from that perspective, I don't actually think it would impact adoption and simplicity. In some ways, it's simpler. And algorithm agility comes \"for free\" from the JWE layer. \r\n\r\nJWE isn't the most space efficient. But it's not terrible. And there are some potential optimizations that could be looked at too, if desired. The likely redundant JWE header looks like a good candidate. But I digress for now... \r\n\r\nSome info about the size of the underlying data does maybe leak here (b/c the cipher text size will vary with the size of the plain text) vs. the hash. But I'm having a hard time seeing how that could be meaningfully consequential in this context. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I always feel uncomfortable when symmetric keys are being sent in the clear. If we added confidentiality protection for the symmetric keys it can be done using established key management techniques. I imagine an approach where the structure with the symmetric keys are encrypted with the holder public key. When the holder wants to perform disclosure, the holder decrypt the structure, extract the key it wants to share, create the disclosure document and then encrypts it with the verifiers public key. The verifier would then decrypt the disclosure structure, extract the symmetric keys, and decrypt the fields in the JD-SWT.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of protecting the encryption keys is that it mitigates against accidental disclosure if the structure with the symmetric keys gets logged/exfiltrated, and the holder can store it as received from the issuer (protecting data at rest).\r\n\r\nThe downside is extra key management, but perhaps a worthwhile option given that we are building a privacy preserving capability.",

Implicitly, since authenticated encryption is used, the verifier would validate that the claim values have not been modified.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice construction as it combines the advantages of the hash and encryption approaches: The verifier cannot skip the check of the signature and the SD-JWT remains fairly small. Also, we don't unnecessarily share encrypted values.\r\n\r\nNow here's the problem: \r\n\r\n- If we use symmetric encryption, the holder would be able to create new ciphertexts for the signed keys. We can't allow that, so we must use **asymmetric encryption**.\r\n- This means that the issuer creates a key pair (public/private) for each claim value. If the issuer now uses (as usual) the public key to encrypt the claim values, he would need to **sign/share the private key in the SD-JWT.** That's bad, not only because private keys are not meant to be shared, but because you can often derive the public key from the private key and the holder could again create new ciphertexts. [Somebody (@christianpaquin @PieterKas) correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know \"you can't derive the public key from the private key\" is not a guarantee any encryption algorithm available in JOSE provides.]\r\n- Therefore, the issuer has to use the *private* key to encrypt and then sign/share the *public* key. This is essentially what happens in signatures, but the problem is, that JWE does not foresee this. This means that it is probably not easy to implement or error-prone when attempted.\r\n\r\nAlso, performance considerations.",

The idea is to use the authentication tag of a symmetric JWE similar to the hash value in the salted hash approach. Then include the rest of the JWE in the release container for each claim. For each released claim, the verifier appends the tag on the back of the rest of the JWE and decrypts to get the value. Because it's authenticated encryption, the decryption includes an integrity check. Treating the authenticated decryption as a single operation (which isn't strictly true but you'd have to go out of you way to separate them and mess it up) means the verifier cannot skip the tag/hash check while accessing the claim values. And the tags are under the signature of the SD-JWT. A bit more detail with examples follows.\r\n\r\nA symmetric encryption key is put in the `sd_tags` container of SD-JWT.

          "body": "> FWIW, I'll briefly describe another solution here that I came up with during our call on Friday - and say why it doesn't work.\r\n> \r\n> The idea I had was that the issuer creates an encryption key for each claim value, encrypts the claim value, and provides the _key_ - not the ciphertext - in the SD-JWT. The SVC would contain the ciphertexts instead of the keys, and the holder would release a subset of the ciphertexts to the verifier. The verifier would use the keys signed by the issuer plus the ciphertexts to get the claim values. Implicitly, since authenticated encryption is used, the verifier would validate that the claim values have not been modified.\r\n> \r\n> This is a nice construction as it combines the advantages of the hash and encryption approaches: The verifier cannot skip the check of the signature and the SD-JWT remains fairly small. Also, we don't unnecessarily share encrypted values.\r\n> \r\n> Now here's the problem:\r\n> \r\n> * If we use symmetric encryption, the holder would be able to create new ciphertexts for the signed keys. We can't allow that, so we must use **asymmetric encryption**.\r\n> * This means that the issuer creates a key pair (public/private) for each claim value. If the issuer now uses (as usual) the public key to encrypt the claim values, he would need to **sign/share the private key in the SD-JWT.** That's bad, not only because private keys are not meant to be shared, but because you can often derive the public key from the private key and the holder could again create new ciphertexts. [Somebody (@christianpaquin @PieterKas) correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know \"you can't derive the public key from the private key\" is not a guarantee any encryption algorithm available in JOSE provides.]\r\n> * Therefore, the issuer has to use the _private_ key to encrypt and then sign/share the _public_ key. This is essentially what happens in signatures, but the problem is, that JWE does not foresee this. This means that it is probably not easy to implement or error-prone when attempted.\r\n> \r\n> Also, performance considerations.\r\n\r\n@danielfett I was thinking about the practical implications of the proposal  after our call and agree that in practice there will be opportunities for implementation errors. \r\n\r\nIn theory, the mathematical properties of public and private key pairs are equivalent. However, most implementations optimise for speed by picking fixed values and parameters (in the case of RSA, the public exponent is often short and fixed as 65537). It often also includes other parameters that can be used to compute intermediate steps, which in turn may be handy when optimising the implementation, but ends up helping the cryptanalyst. It could be overcome, but would make use of standard crypto libraries difficult, leading to the point of custom crypto library implementations, which is worse in my view than the ill we are trying to cure (comparing hashes). So agreed that this particular approach may not get us there, but @bc-pi iteration looks interesting ;)",

If the attacker knows the key + tag, it's apparently not too difficult to forge a message with new ciphertext that authenticates against the same tag.  I was (apparently naively) thinking that the AEAD tag provides similar properties to a secure hash or hmac (one of the JWE constructions uses AES CBC + HMAC SHA2 to provide an AEAD, which influenced my thinking) - particularly something like second preimage resistance that would make such forgery infeasible - but sounds like my assumption there is wrong.

Hashing, as currently in the main branch. Cons: The potential footgun of missing the hash check, slightly awkward JSON-in-JSON encoding. Pros: Aligned with mDL and established there, relatively compact, easy to implement.\r\n2. Encryption with release of key. Cons: A length sidechannel, having to select algorithms carefully, and potentially very large SD-JWTs. Relying on lesser used features (JWE instead of JWS+hashing). Pros: No footgun for the verifier.\r\n3. Encryption with tag/key in SD-JWT and release of ciphertext. Cons: Relying on a crypto property we should not rely on. Pros: No footgun, smaller SD-JWTs.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear that (3) is out. \r\nComparing (1) and (2), I think that (1) is the better option. Yes, the footgun of (1) is a large one, but at least it is only one.

In that approach the issuer will generate a SD-JWT that contains the hashes and the SVC. The SVC will be encrypted with the holders public key, so that a verifier cannot access the SVC data. \r\n\r\nThe holder will decrypt the SVC structure in the SD-JWT, decide which claims to present, and then include them in the SD-JWT-R. To avoi concatenation of the SD-JWT and SD-JWT-R, the SD-JWT can include the SD-JWT as an attribute.

We already know that tokens and authorization codes end up in log files, and the SVC will as well. Attackers will (and do) hoover up these artefacts, so protecting their contents seems appropriate. I worry about designing a privacy preserving feature that passes the data it seeks to control around in cleartext. \r\n\r\nIn terms of complexity, encrypting the entire structure will be much simpler than the field level encryption being proposed in https://github.com/oauthstuff/draft-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/30. From an implementation perspective we already encrypt token contents in certain cases to preserve privacy, so there is evidence that this can be achieved at scale. Encrypting an entire structure with a single key does come across as simpler than encrypting each field with a different \r\n\r\nThe concerns about weak keys and weak algorithms can be addressed by specifying the algorithm suits that should be used and avoiding constructs like Alg:NONE. Conformance suites can enforce this in time. \r\n\r\nIt is an interesting point to consider forward secrecy in the context of selective disclosure. There are ways to solve for that through algorithm selection, ephemeral keys or just rolling keys. It still feels like a better problem to have than not protecting the SVC at all and probably applies to https://github.com/oauthstuff/draft-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/30 as well. I do agree that including the encrypted SVC in the SD-JWT expands the impact of a future algorithm failure as there are more places where the encrypted payload will be available. However, encrypting the SVC and keeping it outside of the SD-JT still feels like a better option, even in the face of a possible future algorithm compromise (at least there is some protection in the present).",

The verifier must always check the signature to ensure that the SD-JWT has not been tampered with and that the claims included were not modified since the SD-JWT was signed by the issuer. If the signature on the SD-JWT cannot be verified the SD-JWT should be rejected. If the SD-JWT is not signed, an attacker may modify claims (e.g. change the \"sub\" attribute to identify another subject or \"address\" to modify a shipping address for goods ordered), thereby forging the issuer assertion. An attacker may also choose to add optional claims that the issuer had not asserted (e.g. adding an attribute indicating an academic qualification).\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "My two eurocents on this: A clearer distinction between the different JWTs and JSON documents we're dealing with will help to inform the decision on this issue.\r\n\r\n* We do have the SD-JWT, a normal JWT with the special claim `sd_digests`.\r\n* Then there is the SVC, let's ignore that for a moment.\r\n* Then the SD-JWT-R, another normal JWT (or a plain JSON structure) with some special claims.\r\n* Finally, the verifier may synthesize a data structure from the SD-JWT plus the SD-JWT-R. This data structure contains the same data an application would otherwise maybe have received via a JWT from the issuer directly, and its integrity can be traced back to the issuer as well. Let's call this data the **result** (of the SD-JWT(-R) verification).\r\n\r\nThis result will have the same claim names as ID Tokens in some cases. In some cases, it might look like an access token according to RFC9068. In other cases, will conform to <insert_spec_here>.\r\n\r\nBut the SD-JWT that was the basis for this result will never be an ID token, or an RFC9068 compliant access token, or an <insert_spec_here> compliant token, because it uses a special claims container (`sd_digests`), and the claim values are hashes, not actual claim values. Maybe the structure is completely different.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the `typ` of the original SD-JWT cannot be `jwt` or `at+jwt` or `<insert_spec_here>+jwt`. If anything, it should be something like `sd+jwt`. Same for the SD-JWT-R, maybe the `typ` should be `sd-r+jwt` as proposed before.\r\n\r\nBut: There might be room for another `typ`-like information, maybe in a new claim `sd_headers`, to indicate what the `typ` of the result will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"typ\": \"sd+jwt\"\r\n}.\r\n{\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://example.com/issuer\",\r\n  \"sub_jwk\": {\r\n    \"kty\": \"RSA\",\r\n    \"n\": \"pm4bOHBg-oYhAyPWzR56AWX3rUIXp11_ICDkGgS6W3ZWLts-hzwI3x65659kg4hVo9dbGoCJE3ZGF_eaetE30UhBUEgpGwrDrQiJ9zqprmcFfr3qvvkGjtth8Zgl1eM2bJcOwE7PCBHWTKWYs152R7g6Jg2OVph-a8rq-q79MhKG5QoW_mTz10QT_6H4c7PjWG1fjh8hpWNnbP_pv6d1zSwZfc5fl6yVRL0DV0V3lGHKe2Wqf_eNGjBrBLVklDTk8-stX_MWLcR-EGmXAOv0UBWitS_dXJKJu-vXJyw14nHSGuxTIK2hx1pttMft9CsvqimXKeDTU14qQL1eE7ihcw\",\r\n    \"e\": \"AQAB\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"iat\": 1516239022,\r\n  \"exp\": 1516247022,\r\n  \"sd_headers\": {\r\n    \"typ\": \"something+jwt\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"sd_digests\": {\r\n    \"sub\": \"LbnhkOr5oS7KjeUrxezAu8TG0CpWz0jSixy6tffuo04\",\r\n    \"given_name\": \"fUMdn88aaoyKTHrvZd6AuLmPraGhPJ0zF5r_JhxCVZs\",\r\n    \"family_name\": \"9h5vgv6TpFV6GmnPtugiMLl5tHetHeb5X_2cKHjN7cw\",\r\n    \"email\": \"fPZ92dtYMCN2Nb-2ac_zSH19p4yakUXrZl_-wSgaazA\",\r\n    \"phone_number\": \"QdSffzNzzd0n60MsSmuiKj6Y6Enk2b-BS-KtEePde5M\",\r\n    \"address\": \"JFu99NUXPq55f6DFBZ22rMkxMNHayCrfPG0FDsqbyDs\",\r\n    \"birthdate\": \"Ia1Tc6_Xnt5CJc2LtKcu6Wvqr42glBGGcjGOye8Zf3U\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA verifier could use this information to reject the SD-JWT early without checking anything else, and to avoid type confusion attacks as usual.",

Leave that to the application to use (or not) as appropriate. But `\"typ\": \"sd+jwt\"` isn't really meaningful or useful on it's own (similar to `\"typ\": \"JWT\"`, the WTF from RFC7519) and so we don't need special SD-JWT features for it. \r\n\r\nIt _maybe_ worthwhile to define media type(s) for the combined format(s) that could be used to signal what the thing is in like HTTP `Content-Type` or `cty` header of an enclosing JWE.

      "body": "# Comments\r\nFrom the current version of the document, the security and privacy target is not really defined but only a mechanism is defined as \u201cAn SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed document containing hashes over the claim values with unique salts and other metadata. It MUST be digitally signed using the issuer's private key\u201d. Explicitly defining security and privacy goals may be desired. \r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n \r\nAdd the following at the beginning of \u201cConcept\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the collection limitation, which is one of the main privacy principles, it is desirable to be able to provide only the claims necessary for the verifier to process. In the case of a standard JWT [RFC7519], however, this can only be achieved when the JWT is minted afresh each time and it is not possible to re-use the JWT that is pre-minted for other occasions. For example, a holder may want to re-use the document that contains name, address (municipality, street address, room number), date of birth, and National Identification Number to prove that he is a resident of the municipality so that he can receive the service to the resident. In the case of the normal JWT, this is not possible as the signature is over the entire claim set directly. To achieve it, a JWT that only contains the claim about the municipality needs to be minted. \r\n\r\nSelective disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) aims to address this issue by introducing an indirection: sign the salted hash of the claims instead of the claim set and provide only the claim value of the claim that is required to be processed by the receiver, which assumes the verifier role. This way, while the claim names and the salted hash of the claim values of all the claims contained in the document issued by the issuer is disclosed, the claim values of other claims are not in principle. \r\n\r\nIn this document, a protocol is considered to fulfil the selective disclosure property when it has the following properties: \r\n\r\n## R1. Strong uncoverability\r\n\r\nA protocol is said to achieve strong uncoverability if the adversary acting as the verifier cannot successfully find the claim values that were not intended to be disclosed to the verifier, with a probability significantly better than negligible. \r\n\r\n## R2. Weak uncoverability\r\n\r\nWhile strong uncoverability is desirable, it is not trivial to achieve it. For example, if the original document was a passport that came with the signature of the national authority, then just by looking at the issuer and its signature, it is trivial to find the nationality of the subject in the release. Also, if the existence of the claim name in the release makes it possible for the verifier to guess the value with a probability significantly better than negligible, then it does not satisfy strong uncoverability. \r\n\r\nWith these considerations, weak uncoverability is defined as follows: \r\n\r\nA protocol is said to achieve weak uncoverability if the adversary acting as the verifier cannot successfully find the claim values that were not intended to be disclosed to the verifier from the section of the release that directly corresponds with the claim, with a probability significantly better than negligible.  \r\n\r\n## R3. Release confidentiality\r\n\r\nA protocol is said to achieve release confidentiality if the adversary that can observe the content of all protocol exchanges between the holder agent and the verifier cannot find the claims with a probability significantly better than negligible. \r\n\r\n## R4. Unforgeability\r\n\r\nUnforegeability ensures that an adversary acting as a holder (dishonest holder) cannot forge a release that makes the verifier believe the false value.  \r\n\r\nThe game is defined as follows. Arbitrary entities play the role of issuer and verifier while the adversary plays the role of the holder at each stage of the protocol. A is subjected to the game where sequentially: \r\n\r\n1. Issuer and verifier execute the setup/registration phase (if any). \r\n2. Issuer and adversary playing the role of holder execute the issuance phase in which issuer issues claim set attached to the honest holder C to the adversary. \r\n3. Adversary playing the role of holder and verifier executes the release phase for a policy P that is not satisfied by C. \r\n4. The winning event for the adversary is defined as a successful authentication towards the verifier. \r\n\r\nThe protocol achieves unforgeability if it is unfeasible for the adversary to win with a probability significantly better than negligible. \r\n\r\n## Security and privacy target of SD-JWT and SD-JWT release\r\n\r\nT1. SD-JWT, SD-JWT release with associated protocol execution fulfils R2, R3, and R4. \r\n\r\nNote: See privacy consideration for more discussion.",

SD-JWT does not allow the attacker to create a release that would make verifier to trust claim values not originally signed by the issuer.\r\n \r\n- On 1 and 2, this is where in my mind this cannot be achieved only by using SD-JWT, but requires other \"protocols\". Plain text release contains actual claim values! so to achieve this property, release has to be sent over TLS, or session encrypted BLE/NFC, but we cannot force that in this SD-JWT document itself. and this is where audience restriction and nonces also come into play.\r\n- On 3, I agree with this one. it is achieved by including hashes in SD-JWT, but can be undermined if verifier does not perform hash computation.",

      "body": "# Comment\r\nWhile many people attached in this field seem to focus on loosely defined notion of unlinkability, it is not only the factor to be considered. Also, the notion of unlinkability can be more regorously defined as in ISO/IEC 27551 and it is essential to consider in that rigor. \r\n\r\n# Proposal: \r\nUse the following text. \r\n\r\n# Privacy considerations\r\n\r\nPrivacy protection can be considered from the following principles per ISO/IEC 29100.  \r\n\r\n\t1.\tConsent and choice \r\n\t2.\tPurpose legitimacy and specification \r\n\t3.\tCollection limitation \r\n\t4.\tData minimization \r\n\t5.\tUse, retention and disclosure limitation \r\n\t6.\tAccuracy and quality \r\n\t7.\tOpenness, transparency and notice \r\n\t8.\tIndividual participation and access \r\n\t9.\tAccountability \r\n\t10.\tInformation security \r\n\t11.\tPrivacy compliance \r\n\r\nAmong them, this document is concerned directly with 3. Collection limitation and indirectly/partially with 1. Consent and choice, 2. Purpose legitimacy and specification, 6. Accuracy and quality, and 10. Information security.  \r\n\r\nOften talked unlinkability is a subset of 3. Collection limitation as it amounts to providing unintended (by the holder) information such as the fact that the holder visited a verifier to another verifier. \r\n\r\n## Collection limitation\r\n\r\nIn this document, Collection limitation is considered from two aspects. \r\n\r\n1. Uncoverability\r\n2. Unlinkability\r\n\r\n### Uncoverability\r\n\r\nThe concept of uncoverability was discussed in clause 3. In this subclause, this document further discusses it in more detail. \r\n\r\n#### Uncovering the values of non-existent claims from issuer identifier\r\nWhen an issuer issues only one type of SD-JWT, it is often possible to recover some attributes about the holder. \r\nFor example, if the issuer was an authority that only issues driver's licenses in this format, \r\nthen, just by looking at the issuer and the document itself, it can be deterministically recovered that the holder has a driving license. While revealing that the holder has a driving license may not have much privacy impact, \r\nif it was other attributes, it could be quite a privacy-sensitive. \r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the case where the SD-JWT was issued by National Cancer Centre. \r\nThen, by just looking at the issuer, it is possible to deduce that the holder is a cancer patient. \r\nThis may have a fair amount of privacy impact. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate this kind of issue, a group of issuers may elect to use a common issuer identifier and use a group signature scheme instead of an individual signature. \r\n\r\n#### Uncovering the values of non-existent claims from the list of claim names\r\nEven if a group of issuers uses a common issuer identifier, if the claims used are unique from one issuer to another, \r\nthe list of the claim names would be enough to identify the real issuer. In this case, the values of non-existent claims can be uncovered in the same manner as described in the previous subclause. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate this kind of issue, the group of issuers may elect to use a common set of claims and always include them in the SD-JWT. \r\n\r\n#### Uncovering the claim value where the number of possible values is limited\r\n\r\nWhen the number of possible values of the claim is limited, it is trivial to uncover the actual value from the salt and the hash. \r\nIt suffices to iterate over the possible values with the provided hash. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate this kind of issue, the issuer may add a random string to provide entropy at the end of the actual value with an appropriate delimiter in the case the value is a string. For other data types like boolean, some other mechanisms should be considered, e.g., defining a transform from boolean to a string using the entropy string. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Unlinkability\r\n\r\nThe notion of unlinkability cannot be defined precisely without specifying the role assumed by the adversary and the target of the attack. In ISO/IEC 27551, the following notation is used to describe a different kind of unlinkability. \r\n\r\n    (Adversary)\u2013(Target) Unlinkability\r\n\r\nNOTE: The notation is modified to group the Adversary and Target with a parenthesis to make it easier to read when adopted this document's entity name. \r\n\r\nIn the case two parties are colluding as the adversary, the colluding parties are concatenated with \"+\" sign to express it. \r\n\r\n    (Adversar1+Adversary2)\u2013(Target) Unlinkability\r\n\r\nThe same applies to the target. \r\n\r\nWith this notation, ISO/IEC 27551 defines the following eight types of unlinkability. (Entity names are modified to match this document. Corresponding ISO/IEC 27551 unlinkability names are given in braces after it). \r\n\r\n1. (Passive Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [PO-U]\r\n2. (Active Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AO-U]\r\n3. (Verifier 1 + Verifier 2)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP+RP'\u2013U]\r\n4. (Issuer)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP\u2013U]\r\n5. (Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP\u2013U]\r\n6. (Issuer)\u2013(Verifier) Unlinkability [AP\u2013RP]\r\n7. (Issuer+Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP+RP-U]\r\n8. (Issuer)\u2013(Holder+Verifier) Unlinkability [AP-RP+U]\r\n\r\n#### (Passive Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [PO-U]\r\nWhen all the protocol runs are encrypted, e.g., by TLS, then a Passive Outside cannot see the content of SD-JWT and SD-JWT-R. \r\nIn other words, the protocol runs should be encrypted to achieve this unlinkability. \r\n\r\n####  (Active Outsider)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AO-U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Verifier 1 + Verifier 2)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP+RP'\u2013U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP\u2013U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [RP\u2013U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer)\u2013(Verifier) Unlinkability [AP\u2013RP]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer+Verifier)\u2013(Holder) Unlinkability [AP+RP-U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n#### (Issuer)\u2013(Holder+Verifier) Unlinkability [AP-RP+U]\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n## Consent and choice\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Purpose legitimacy and specification\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Accuracy and quality\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Information security\r\n\r\n(TBD)\r\n\r\n",

Is it possible to update the IANA registry with a Recommended Y/N column? Also, shake128 and shake256 are not collision-resistant hash functions, they are XOFs that can produce any length of output - e.g. shake128 with a 32-bit output would not be collision-resistant and thus would not be at all suitable for this usage.

It might not be right thing to do in all situations, but I think it would be useful to at least define one mechanism to do something like that (perhaps even encoding the claims directly in the JWT root). A verifier('s policy) only expects a JWT with some claims; it might not care if they are encoded directly or selectively disclosed from a hash based encoding (or derived from another claim in more advanced systems). Surfacing the calculated claims in the JWT offers the ability for libraries to perform this transformation, and leaving the RP's business logic close to intact.",

      "body": "I would like to propose a very simple and easy-to-implement approach to blinding claim names.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to add a new, optional, third element to the SD releases. Let's assume that there is a privacy-sensitive claims, that might show up in the SD-JWT, say `secret_club_membership_number`, and its mere existence should not be revealed to verifiers.\r\n\r\nThe issuer could create an SD-JWT as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://example.com/issuer\",\r\n  \"iat\": 1516239022,\r\n  \"exp\": 1516247022,\r\n  \"sd_digests\": {\r\n    \"sub\": \"LbnhkOr5oS7KjeUrxezAu8TG0CpWz0jSixy6tffuo04\",\r\n    \"given_name\": \"fUMdn88aaoyKTHrvZd6AuLmPraGhPJ0zF5r_JhxCVZs\",\r\n    \"family_name\": \"9h5vgv6TpFV6GmnPtugiMLl5tHetHeb5X_2cKHjN7cw\",\r\n    \"G1fjh8hpWNnb\": \"Ia1Tc6_Xnt5CJc2LtKcu6Wvqr42glBGGcjGOye8Zf3U\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"hash_alg\": \"sha-256\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issuer has replaced the claim name `secret_club_membership_number` with an arbitrary string. \r\n\r\nOnly the SVC (and later the SD-JWT-R) would release the claim name:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"sd_release\": {\r\n    \"sub\": \"[\\\"eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A\\\", \\\"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c\\\"]\",\r\n    \"given_name\": \"[\\\"6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA\\\", \\\"John\\\"]\",\r\n    \"family_name\": \"[\\\"eI8ZWm9QnKPpNPeNenHdhQ\\\", \\\"Doe\\\"]\",\r\n    \"G1fjh8hpWNnb\": \"[\\\"G02NSrQfjFXQ7Io09syajA\\\", \\\"1940-01-01\\\", \\\"secret_club_membership_number\\\"]\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice the third element in the release JSON. It signals to the verifier that the real claim name is different from how the claim was called in the SD-JWT.\r\n\r\nThe verifier would, during the verification step, replace the claim name `G1fjh8hpWNnb` with the now learned correct claim name `secret_club_membership_number`.\r\n\r\nInstead of random string as claim names, anything that is unique works:\r\n \r\n * just numbering all hidden claims: `secret_claim_1`, `secret_claim_1`,...\r\n * random numbers, string, etc.\r\n * also real-looking but fake claim names: `public_club_membership_number`, `birthdate` (security by obscurity?!)\r\n\r\nThis does not hide the number of secret claim names or that a claim at a certain position in a maybe more complex structure exists. @peppelinux proposal on anonymous claims seems to cover that, but if I understand it correctly, it is less fine-grained: https://github.com/oauthstuff/draft-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/80\r\n\r\nWDYAT? @b---c @Sakurann ",

I however think that issuers with a well-known public and fixed issuance schema is a far more common scenario, for which our proposed selective disclosure feature offers a simple and useful solution. I can also imagine scenarios as described in this issue, but I'm not sure how realistic/common they are. I'd be in favor of keeping the spec simple, and explore this extra features in subsequent specs or profiles.\r\n\r\nA solution to the hidden claim name (and value!) is to issue multiple credentials containing various subsets of the available claims. It then helps to know how commonly one is expected to hide the existence of such claims to balance the pain of managing multiple credentials vs. holding one with this selective disclosure feature.",

If a label for something is actually a secret, it should be treated as such. That said, I get that this scenario must be addressed. Sensitive predicates or graduated disclosure contexts can benefit from this capability. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the most useful and easy algorithm to implement is to use the same hash algorithm + salt for the node value to blind the label where: SALTED LABEL = HASH_ALGO(LABEL + SALT)\r\nOf course, this assumes that specific guidance is included for best practice salt generation (fresh entropy gathering for each attribute block salt, sufficient bits of entropy, etc.) for strong cryptographic outcomes.\r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"9-J2445a_p91...\": {\r\n    \"h\": \"Y823Kowek92...\", // b64url\r\n    \"l\": \"name\"\r\n    \"s\": \"H82leq3!4...\", // re-use salt\r\n    \"id\": \"did:jwk:894fa94hg10AOEe82\u2026#0\", //claim specific DID URL binding\r\n    \"v\": \"Slim Shady\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this representation, the salted hash of the label's value (\"name\") \"9-J2445a_p91...\" can be addressed directly by the digest \"h\" value in compact form: \r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"9-J2445a_p91...\": \"Y823Kowek92...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSide-note:\r\nInformative statements that recommend large sd-jwt claim sets should be 'broken down' into much smaller sets, or individual claims, then wrapped and sealed as a JWP may be better than including too many claims in an sd-jwt.\r\n\r\n",

Select the placeholder as some function of the original claim name (the label in your proposal) and the salt\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to express is that I think option 1 is better. From a security perspective, both are equivalent. There is no need to choose the placeholder claim name in a particular way, we just need to ensure that it does not leak information about the original claim name. Just numbering all placeholder claim names would be fine as well (as long as the numbering does not reveal anything, e.g., the position of the original claim in the list of claims.) \r\n\r\nBut for option 2, I see two drawbacks:\r\n\r\n - We need to explain more, in particular how to assemble the input for the function, similar to the discussion we had about the hidden claim values. For example, we need to define how the original claim name and the salt are concatenated such that there can be no prefix collisions. \r\n - A verifier receiving an SD-JWT with blinded claim names according to option 2 may be tempted to (needlessly) check that the claim name was created in a particular way by recalculating the hash. If the issuer has made a mistake when calculating the hash or the verifier makes a mistake, this check will fail. Since such a check is not needed, it would be better if we don't set this trap in the first place.\r\n\r\nI see no advantages of option 2 over option 1, so I propose to go for option 1.",

      "body": "## Problem statement\r\n\r\nCurrently, in sd-jwt spec, the recommended representation for JSON property values is to embed escaped JSON that represents a salted hash of the value. This seems to add complexity, room for error, and superfluous verbosity. Instead, specifying that claims in an \"_sd\" container are themselves ONE OF the following: \r\n(a) simple plain-text values\r\n(b) an object of specified properties supporting blinded property values\r\n(c) an object with specified properties supporting a blinded graph\r\n\r\nThere's a good balance of specificity and flexibility here (IMHO) for implementors to accommodate many different scenarios - as opposed to having to unescape and then detect the contents of an attribute's values. With strict conventions on certain attributes of an attribute block, relying parties are guaranteed some properties right away that can be validated before the actual values are read into memory - increasing reliability, security, and permitting faster failure sequences. In addition, writing unit and functional test automation suites for escaped stringified JSON is problematical at best and prone to some of the same formatting problems of concern with structured JSON values. It can also give way to new inconsistent ordering problems during serialized representation testing.\r\n\r\nHowever, per issue 27 - and other discussions that I could uncover, there is ongoing concern over c18n for hash reproducibility. I completely understand why. What I\u2019m proposing might be radioactive, but in this implementor's opinion, is unburdening: I do not think that it\u2019s the SD-JWT spec\u2019s problem to solve data format representation compatibility across all languages and libraries. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think that SD-JWT spec needs to solve for all extended/intermediate representations of claim values - especially when it comes to VC use-cases. In the spirit of good interface building and abstraction, I propose that it\u2019s possible to think of SD-JWT as foundational for other more opinionated specifications.\r\n\r\nIf statements put in attribute values need interpretation, then I\u2019d suggest other means for doing so like metadata encoding specific sections, SD-JWT issuer documentation, JSON Schema, JCS (as an example: RFC 8785 has guidelines for int64 strict encoding). I humbly warn that normatively specifying that values for properties should be escaped JSON AND that you should stuff other important and specified k<>v  pairs in the escaped JSON - is a mistake and will damage adoption for the spec. I don\u2019t think that taking ownership over the shape of claim values should be part of this spec, especially if the goal of a claim is to be \u201canything you want\u201d\u2026\r\n\r\nBoling down the problem of canonicalizing some value(s) - it seems most important to address bitwise value compatibility issues and the way that serialization libraries might handle non-primitive types (as opposed to distressing about ordering). Perhaps there are ways through this that don\u2019t involve incomplete or burdensome canonicalization libraries. Several libraries responsible for producing consistent hashes over JSON (ie: node.js `object-hash`) internally detect and encode incompatible datatypes. Would it be possible for SD-JWT to specify that prior to salting and hashing the attribute - its value must be: \r\nFully compacted (in the case of a JSON graph)\r\nEncoded using utf-8 octal, base64, base64url, hex, or some other specific encoding scheme\r\nThen salted and hashed?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, escaped stringified JSON values as the basis for SVC should probably be rethought. This issue aims to try and start that conversation with some meaningful solutions\r\n\r\nBy way of examples, you could instead represent SD-JWTs as:\r\n\r\n## blinded attribute block\r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"name\": {\r\n    \"h\": \"VGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveCBqdW1wcyBvdmVyIDEzIGxhenkgZG9ncy4=\", // base64url\r\n    \"s\": \"6YCYrdrSxs7q6dlO562YI6GhAktsBExFe6rcCZ+OX9I=\", // base64url\r\n    \"id\": \"did:jwk:894fa94hg10AOEe82\u2026#0\", //claim specific DID URL binding\r\n    \"v\": \"Slim Shady\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExample generation:\r\nHash over the compact form node for \"name\", without the \"h\" property present. Encode the resulting digest in base64url encoding. Insert the digest as property \"h\" into the \"name\" attribute block.\r\n\r\nEnables compact blinded presentation form of \r\n{\"name\": \"VGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveCBqdW1wcyBvdmVyIDEzIGxhenkgZG9ncy4=\"}\r\n\r\nThe underlying salt, which is never revealed unless the \"name\" property value is revealed, disables direct attack on the property - even with the label, type, and validation procedure for the value data of the property is known.\r\n\r\nBy letting JSON be JSON in the entire document structure, you enable an issuer to (optionally) be very specific about the structure of the value entered for an attribute. This further enhances security - especially if the signature (or even simply a hash) of the schema for the SD-JWT is described in the signed-over envelope (in a VC-SD-JWT).\r\n\r\n## blinded, nested eKYC graph\r\n\r\nThe standardized definition of what an eKYC data model is supposed to look like is a bit ambiguous, so I assume what you\u2019re concerned with is something like OIDC...\r\n```\r\n\"_sd\": {\r\n  \"oidc_req\": {\r\n    \"h\": \"...\",\r\n    \"s\": \"...\",\r\n    \"v\": {\r\n      \"scope\": [..., ..., ...],\r\n      \"response_type\": \"code\",\r\n      \"client_id\": \"...\",\r\n      \"redirect_uri\": \"...\",\r\n      \"nonce\": \"...\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe \"v\" of the claim is valid, and validatable JSON. The semantic meaning of the outer, securely disclosable, claim name can be either domain-specific or use a JSON-LD context.\r\n",

The use of the escaped JSON in the credential is what allows SD-JWT to support any type, including objects, for property values. Ideally, anything that builds on top of SD-JWT will not need to handle the escaped JSON format, as (for example) the verification algorithm outputs a JSON without any JSON escaped values for further processing by the application. I'm therefore not convinced that the \"unusual\" format for property values in the credential is a problem.\r\n\r\nThat said, the escaped JSON is not a great solution and raises a lot of eyebrows. But we think that it is the best solution we have. It is trivially easy to implement correctly, using any JSON library out there. The issue we're addressing is not solvable by prescribing a certain JSON schema (as it works on a higher layer). JCS would solve the problem, but increase implementation complexity. Even just compacting objects, as proposed below, is a relatively complex operation requiring a full JSON parser.\r\n",

But I *think* that simplifying to just the hashes might be the way to go.\r\n\r\n- Where does the HMAC key come from? The salt value that would conceptually/presumably be the HMAC key is part of the string literal value that the digest is computed over, which is awkward. But also not explicitly defined. So it's an exercise left up to the reader, which isn't great for interoperability. \r\n- The JOSE alg registry doesn't seem appropriate for the HMAC algs in this different context. And isn't sufficient (see point above) for interoperability.\r\n- Allowing the value to come from two different unrelated registries or \"another specification and/or profile of this specification\" without a registry seems problematic on a number of fronts \r\n- The name `sd_digest_derivation_alg` is longer than typical JWT names (sha 256 could also potentially be a default if the thing isn't present to make things smaller in the common MTI case) \r\n- digest derivation function doesn't seem like a commonly used term\r\n- seems like the alg indicator could/should go under the `sd_digests` rather than being an independent claim at the same level (unless `sd_digests` goes away, which I'm starting to think it should based on conversations with Dr. @danielfett on Tues, in which case this point is moot) \r\n",

There needs to be a separator different from the ones in the JWT itself for distinguishing the JWT from the \"attachment\". So these two would work in that mental model:\r\n`<SD-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>`\r\nor\r\n`<SD-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>.<Disclosure 2>.<...>.<Disclosure N>`\r\n\r\nI assume that your and the devs' mental model is that the whole thing that is being sent is a special form of JWT that consists of four instead of three parts:\r\n`<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>.<Attachment>` where the Attachment is the `~`-separated Disclosures.\r\n\r\nThat would mean, however, that the whole Combined Format is a special kind of JWT with four parts. I don't see it that way. The Combined Format is just a means of sending a JWT and some extra data. ",

I think that we can adopt base64 encodings instead of plain json array if you agree.\r\n\r\nan important aspect of the proposed new structure is the mapping between the digest and the disclosure (which would be encoded in base64 following our last comments). This better explains the mapping between hashed _sd and related disclosure\r\n\r\nalso the disclosure would be resistant to reply attacks by default",

Now if there's an array, we need to go back one level higher to find the _sd element and add more hashes there. The behavior is undefined for arrays-in-arrays.\r\n\r\n@TakahikoKawasaki Did you encounter any of these problems?

The basic idea is to use arrays like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"nationalities\": [\r\n    \"_sd:Q7R_-cBP9LWCq9At1XWNRZyLTFHOr0S9fLcXQjyBgH4\",\r\n    \"_sd:o9qCZPD-_n0pa9nH_sBxtVKXuDyx1ALQjzYPrOJ3p4s\",\r\n    \"DE\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Here, the third element is non-SD.)\r\n\r\nThe main concern that I had with this solution is that there may be conflicts. If somebody has data where `_sd` can appear as part of the data (for example, user-supplied data), the processing will not be correct. Therefore I propose to use `_sd:` as the default prefix, but to allow definition of a different prefix by adding the top-level key `_sd_arr_pfx`. For example, the prefix can consist of a nonce or another string that is guaranteed to not appear in real data items. This approach is similar to [boundaries in multipart MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Content_boundary). (There is no need to use `_sd_arr_pfx` if there are no arrays with SD or if the default prefix is used.)\r\n\r\nThe following is a full SD-JWT payload using the new array feature and defining `_sdx:` as a prefix:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_sd\": [\r\n    \"sGmV2tSLHmJScETevXgTQ-bM7O5ZnQuu-ypqI2vB-JU\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://example.com/issuer\",\r\n  \"iat\": 1683000000,\r\n  \"exp\": 1883000000,\r\n  \"sub\": \"john_doe_42\",\r\n  \"nationalities\": [\r\n    \"_sdx:Q7R_-cBP9LWCq9At1XWNRZyLTFHOr0S9fLcXQjyBgH4\",\r\n    \"_sdx:o9qCZPD-_n0pa9nH_sBxtVKXuDyx1ALQjzYPrOJ3p4s\",\r\n    \"DE\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"is_over\": {\r\n    \"_sd\": [\r\n      \"NKZs2QqvniVtS3k-YXxMag_PiyUQizlgdsXgfIEWZcs\",\r\n      \"hLJKFgko4IvkO_R8lbX3xNRcaEo0t0awFMnrO0dXdvg\",\r\n      \"hN7ybNRpz_UIZAH4rPTNl_c07JyUQtzHlAwuyVrsQgs\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"addresses\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\r\n      \"city\": \"Anytown\",\r\n      \"state\": \"NY\",\r\n      \"zip\": \"12345\",\r\n      \"type\": \"main_address\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"_sdx:TDx4IHvi4gxmIGbEKZa4AM6PYRIHtP5VxjraME72Nh8\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"null_values\": [\r\n    null,\r\n    \"_sdx:YImgtY5gfEpLKDA8PQ93hkUCeAL0lz-UKsnK1IGJHFo\",\r\n    \"_sdx:duZZCCrTo-ROiWT8uEpPkgu_XnpsIWDtXhOqSOJ1EEo\",\r\n    null\r\n  ],\r\n  \"data_types\": [\r\n    \"_sdx:llHOoLZriL1NCNBOB3lLj5cFhZS2I4UvXeWIofOSyzU\",\r\n    \"_sdx:5h5X-YP38eRr7yS1sydUGJzbTXQiYoZy2CELGTpy63w\",\r\n    \"_sdx:ZcGhdemizhDvOKiM3huX69MO5MJ3k_6N4TDADYi1KI8\",\r\n    \"_sdx:MtEhyiQLsysJR9x6XgGPo2AS_audhRVXEZ3GsNVM30o\",\r\n    \"_sdx:auIGvdZGiGSzFmMXxM2ErtbN-5h-y0BIeFsl_aDEN48\",\r\n    \"_sdx:HTw5A7z-pzJ8RI37pC9Z2-1IyM-ZjVYG-iUkhpV4Ahw\",\r\n    \"_sdx:0MZET02ximXt6FxwBPOsEBUxuo_OBlNxQsfmRiatBeY\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"nested_array\": [\r\n    [\r\n      \"_sdx:xlEWQP4kR9414Kyp5YqMNOBFMlcTa4zqR8ueeSVUCbs\",\r\n      \"_sdx:hcy7DI4AiQaPPTw40V6NYGzllLikLeyifv43a7SaX6w\"\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n      \"_sdx:czFUZij2d-W1nAOU68i6khwwphueeOyTwSJDCmh7gIk\",\r\n      \"_sdx:nLEUS7NSV2EUExiiET2itDjWi6dzV7re0Btcf0omUso\"\r\n    ]\r\n  ],\r\n  \"array_with_recursive_sd\": [\r\n    \"boring\",\r\n    \"_sdx:uaf1fEDM93C4zWX_PZlGCgcfkEgvMpEJUCCFozWCccY\",\r\n    [\r\n      \"_sdx:DWRkboVZ-cTya_WGt0-vaaQVmETozAtFip68mxU1Z0I\",\r\n      \"_sdx:RfQ40cSzxPe494mtOEbWjgA-ymegpiBiPyGTz2dyS4M\"\r\n    ]\r\n  ],\r\n  \"_sd_alg\": \"sha-256\",\r\n  \"cnf\": {\r\n    \"jwk\": {\r\n      \"kty\": \"EC\",\r\n      \"crv\": \"P-256\",\r\n      \"x\": \"TCAER19Zvu3OHF4j4W4vfSVoHIP1ILilDls7vCeGemc\",\r\n      \"y\": \"ZxjiWWbZMQGHVWKVQ4hbSIirsVfuecCE6t4jT9F2HZQ\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"_sd_arr_pfx\": \"_sdx:\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code is in the sd-jwt repo, this is not finished yet but you should be able to play with the examples: https://github.com/danielfett/sd-jwt/pull/4\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",

I like about this solution that it doesn't involve string handling and it most likely doesn't need the `_sd_arr_pfx` construction to avoid conflicts. First of all, we're using the already defined \"_sd\", and second, we're only using it as a key value (which is generally less likely to contain very variable or user-supplied data). \r\n\r\nFor the disclosures, I think it makes sense to stick to a two-element format (`[\"eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A\", \"CA\"]`).

And not needing the `_sd_arr_pfx` construction is a plus. Looking at the examples you have, I must admit that I don't love the aesthetics of it. But that shouldn't be part of the criteria for choosing.  \r\n\r\n> using the already defined \"_sd\"\r\n\r\nThis is true and I agree that using a special key name is cleaner than a string prefix and much better avoids conflict.  However, we'd need to be a little careful with it's treatment in the text. There's a lot of current text that would need to be adjusted to allow for the `_sd` key to have different syntax and semantics based on where it is in the JSON. [This sentence](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-04.html#section-5.1.1.4-6) and [these steps](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-04.html#section-6.2-4.4.1) are just two examples. Which might be tricky and risky. We might want to use a new special key name. Maybe `_sda` or  `_sdae` or something (roughly for selectively disclosable array element but I'm just throwing out ideas). A different key might also be easier to see the difference when just looking at the JSON. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

What do @TakahikoKawasaki @Sakurann think?\r\n\r\nI think that using a different key makes sense. It is easier to implement (\"check for _sde\" instead of \"check for a single-element object, where _sd refers to a string not an array\") and we avoid polymorphism (`_sd` is always an array, `_sde` is always a string).\r\n\r\nNow for the bikeshedding part:\r\n\r\n- Ideally, we would use two or max three characters after the underscore.\r\n- `_sdae` is quite long\r\n- `_sda` or `_sde` (selective disclosure element) looks like a linux harddisk path, but would be fine\r\n- `_sa` or `_se` would short, but what would that stand for? `_se` is at least alphabetically next after `_sd`.\r\n- `_[]` or `[]` would look array-ish, but readers might interpret to much into the meaning of the string (\"Can I write `_[2]`?\")\r\n- just `_` is too short and might cause conflicts\r\n- `[_]` looks like a nice placeholder, but doesn't follow our own convention to start with `_`\r\n- `...` transports the meaning that something is elided at this position in the array (and this is an operator with a remotely related meaning both in JavaScript and Python)\r\n- `__` or `_*` or `_:` or `=>` are other options, but I don't think I like them\r\n\r\nAny other ideas? I think I like `...` and `_se` most.",

JAdES signatures need JSON Serialization for the most signature levels: B-T, B-LT, B-LTA. \r\n\r\nI agree with @Sakurann and would prefer not to embed the disclosures in the SD-JWT JSON object. My additional arguments:\r\n\r\n- If the disclosures are contained in the same object as the SD-JWT, the user is more likely to forget to extract the disclosures before the presentation, which would result in a full disclosure. The first part of the issuance Combined Format should be passed untouched in the first part of the pressentation Combined Format.\r\n- The first part of the Combined Format should be a well-formed JWT or JSON-Encoded JWS which can be directly validated without removing parts of the JSON Object.\r\n\r\nI have two related questions:\r\nShould the JSON serialized SD-JWT be base64url encoded in the Combined Formats to avoid `~` or other special characters in the SD-JWT part? This would mean:\r\n\r\n`base64url(SD-JWT in JSON Serialization)~Disclosures~HolderBindingJWT`\r\n\r\nHow to distinguish between the two serializations on the holder and verifier side?

I think realistically, based on the trust framework/interoperability profile, holder/verifier will know which serialization to expect. otherwise, holder/verifier needs to check every time after b64url decoding an SD-JWT part for the serialization, based on things like the presence of a JWS header..",

A verifier would need to deal with disclosed claims under an undisclosed name. The approach would need to say whether clear text claims would be allowed under a blinded name/key.

That is a bit excessive. However, having read a bit about the topic. Since there is no cryptographically secure RNG of the operating system, it is possible to analyze the decoys to determine entropy / detect patterns, thereby undermining security. but hashing the RNG output just makes this process a lot slower. It simply adds computational overhead to any attempt to brute force it. \r\n\r\nIt seems to that the text simply \"inherited\" the security best practice from generating sensitive material like tokens. In the context of decoys the risks are perhaps not that great, but it is not like adding a SHA256 step results in any performance hit",

The integrity of the number of disclosures sent by the holder over what really should be a secure channel anyway just doesn't seem like a concern to me.

Really what a lack of holder integrity does here in general is introduce ambiguity, e.g did the verifier strip claims from a presentation, did the holder never reveal them or did someone in the middle drop them.

There is no obvious way how to sign over the JSON-serialized SD-JWT in that case.\r\n\r\nUnderstand there is complexity here and a solution would need to exist for consistency reasons one such that I believe would work is [the solution I proposed above](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/277#issuecomment-1565205222) which is slightly more complex then validating a single hash, but very much the kind of expected behaviour already going on with SD-JWT when it comes to validating disclosures.\r\n\r\n> The specification promises integrity of the data, but does not guarantee to the verifier that a holder wanted to release this exact dataset even in presence of an adversary. We should call this out more expicitly and will create a PR for this.\r\n\r\nIm not sure what the presences of an adversary here has to do with it, this is about having no ambiguity around what was sent and that once that presentation is prepared it cant be modified in anyway without it being cryptographically invalid.\r\n\r\n> In the presence of such a powerful adversary, it seems plausible that the protection can be circumvented or stronger attacks can be mounted; e.g., by manipulating the request to the holder as well.\r\n\r\nI think this is kind of a seperate issue, if the holder was tricked into revealing more information then intended that doesn't negate the need for wanting integrity around what was presented, in fact ironically it perhaps underscores the importance of having such an integrity check in the first place.\r\n\r\n> For these reasons, integrity and non-repudiation of the message, if needed, must be provided by the transport protocol (in the most simple form by TLS to protect integrity, but things like JARM can provide a second layer for integrity and provide non-repudiation).\r\n\r\nThis is certainly possible but part of the point I was trying to make is it splits where the integrity in a presented SD-JWT comes from, e.g most of it is from the signatures, the rest from the transport and that can make it awkward to evaluate from a security perspective. \r\n\r\n> Hashing can be hard to debug and adds another complexity for developers.\r\n\r\nI mean considering how much hashing is used as a primitive in this spec I really do find it a bit hard to believe this check is where implementations will struggle. I agree it adds another check though which is additional implementation work, but I think the cost is worth it. \r\n\r\nAs a compromise perhaps it could be added as an optional check in the sort of same way the at_hash is optional in OpenID Connect (for different reasons entirely of course).",

The whole selective disclosure mechanism relies on that - any decoy digest or Disclosure that the holder doesn't release will have a digest in the SD-JWT payload or referenced disclosures that is unused (meaning that it doesn't reference a Disclosure that exists from the verifiers perspective).\r\n\r\nI think this comment thread was mostly about how to treat unreferenced Disclosures though. Current text has the holder reject.  For the verifier it's maybe a bit ambiguous now with the text Daniel quoted above while no mention in the actual verification algorithm steps. #244 did result in thinking it was not needed. But I think it'd be good to treat unreferenced Disclosures the same for both Holder and Verifier as it might make code paths for general checking the whole SD-JWT more reusable.  And honestly either reject or ignore would seem okay. \r\n\r\n",

For example implementations already need to track during the substitution phase that a disclosure isn't substitute twice right? So it wouldn't be that complex to just say for all the disclosures substituted make sure it matches the set you started with.",

This would be carried with-in the VP exchange, next to the SD-JWT.  The self-issued VC should refer to the correct SD-JWT as there might be many. Holder binding would also be covered.\r\n\r\nSecond alternative approach to disclosing the Disclosures would be just the use of VP itself.

I admire all the magnificent work this team is doing.\r\n\r\nThe current proposal appends information to the JWS. And the appended information can be of two types: issuer issued disclosure, and holder binding. Hence, this document is defining a new signature format for compact serialised JWS. This is also reflected in the newly registered IANA media types specified in the document.\r\n\r\nThis comment is addressing Compact Serialised JWS\r\n\r\nJWS defines media types: JOSE and JOSE+JSON\r\nIf my understanding is correct, media types could also be just: JOSE+sd+jwt (and the one with holder binding JWT)\r\nJWS libraries don't recognise the new typ, hence the comment about breaking the JWS implementation.\r\n\r\nBy inspecting https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf and https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7797, there appeared to be a solution that is compatible with the existing JWS, however, it turns out that one cannot combine two JWS signatures without additional serialisation. Namely, in some cases issuer would like to sign the sd-jwt, but also the issuer issued disclosures to have a proof that it shared everything with the holder.\r\n\r\nThe only case where we benefit from smaller size is when issuer-issued disclosures are unsigned and when holder selected disclosures are unsigned. Key binding is not securing the payload (it could solve part of the problem)\r\n\r\nIf holder needs to sign the whole payload (for integrity/nonrepudiation/...), I believe section 7 is the one that's useful, and is applicable to JWT, VCs, ..., any other JSON.\r\n\r\nQuestions are:\r\n- should the structure presented in section 7 be the default one - there's a claim disclosures. (this also solves the issue with JWS mentioned above)\r\n- should the structure in sec. 7 adopt syntax from JSON serialised JWS - introducing the disclosures claim in the payload \r\n- render the current JWS compact serialisation as a way to do SD when disclosures are unsigned and when size is an issue\r\n\r\nWith this we cover all cases in an unambiguous way\r\n- JSON serialised JWS works as described. If disclosures need to be signed over, they can also be moved to the protected header\r\n- JWS libs as they are can be used to sign and verify signatures of SD\r\n- issuer can sign the disclosures (if required)\r\n- holder can sign the disclosures (if required)\r\n- if size limit is a constraint, there's an optimisation as presented in the document.

The SD-JWT design is great, and would definitely work, but the issue is open because I do think that it could be even better.\r\n\r\nThe section 7 also introduces the original issue of double encoding, which is why the tilde exists in first place. Luckily the JWS Compacted serialization is not the only option so I crafted the small examples for the [JWS Unencoded Payload](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7797) WITH JWS Flattened serialization.\r\n\r\nThe actual structure for the wrapper can be anything, it contains SD-JWT as is (no double encoding), the Disclosures are signed, and the thing do not need new a content-type. The JWS Flattened expects \"string\" output and byte input, thus the JSON object we are carrying must be encoded to be compatible. I have chosen JSON serialisation, aka stringifying the JSON object in this case. Feel free to propose amendments, alternatives or deeper data structures. The data structures can also be used to solve the disclosures mapping, as with this we have real data structure to express information. If there is a need to transfer this information over URI, it can be made URI compatible through normal encoding practises (which skips base64url, thus there is no double encoding for sd-jwt).\r\n\r\nThe Issuance \"wrapper\": replacing tilde and preserving everything else.\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  signature: 'u0OKqXBRq_hXhcKkmnZ5XGi3Lm9t2-2RpcjdGkocwo2u7bpCE0nJZ92DsBmCay-ZZij5lO5e6Ebk9WoG1zJsPg',\r\n  payload: '{\"sd\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.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.qbKCK100Pqg1fJPKS1QXmI4u1bwPQSMewMQxzD19sf4qgk_hIWQRBy4BTbADYrQa30ct8no0dhV--PZREkjf5A\",\"disclosures\":[\"WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgImZhbWlseU5hbWUiLCAiQ2Fycm9sbCJd\",\"WyJlbHVWNU9nM2dTTklJOEVZbnN4QV9BIiwgImdpdmVuTmFtZSIsICJMZXdpcyJd\",\"WyI2SWo3dE0tYTVpVlBHYm9TNXRtdlZBIiwgImJpcnRoRGF0ZSIsICIxODMyLTAxLTI3Il0\"]}',\r\n  protected: 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJWK keys for validation\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  kty: \"EC\",\r\n  d: \"z617Hhdusxqt3KN98NHvFtWTpSW_sq2cCZpNSzu8m88\",\r\n  crv: \"P-256\",\r\n  x: \"ZYE6uX3XvQ9rLc6s0eeo2YiOM2VfwrEZOZXzTOthcHE\",\r\n  y: \"k-t1bfe-MmmXWQ0QaxK3uJMYlMNkJHYGUSLpxP9RQak\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also good to refresh the memory that URI/URL components do not use content-type at all in HTTP, the media-type is meant for the HTTP body only. The SD-JWT + Disclosures with tilde will break all existing JWT parsers when transported outside of HTTP body, or the processing must be forced into application logic and the tilde pre-processing must be handled there beforehand.\r\n\r\n----\r\nEdit: re-order and add json stringify clarification.",

Thank you for the swift reply. JSON serialisation supports multiple signatures. First protects the SD-JWT, as today, second one protects the whole payload.\r\n\r\n> We are concerned about places where the character set is limited to URL-safe characters like an OAuth bearer token. That would require another round of base64url-encoding the proposed format.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like an interesting use case. Can you elaborate in which scenarios SD-JWTs would be transferred as bearer tokens?\r\n\r\n> We're not breaking the JWS parser in any way. The current format is just not meant to be fed into an JWS parser directly, and that is perfectly fine. The JWS parser in the current format is meant to run after extracting the various parts.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that in the limit, where noting is hidden, extra 'tilde' is still required and with it another serialisation - even though that doesn't have to be the case. We can (at least in our use cases) always go with JSON serialisation and leave the compact for the cases where there's no other option.",

URL components cannot carry Media-Types, thus it is a burden for the implementors to do this kind of check for one specific data structure. This data structure requires new types in OID4 standards, as it is not jwt_vc_json or jwt_vc_ld, but \"jwt_sd_tilde\"?. A pattern where each data structure defines own media-types, external types, etc is not sustainable and ask you again to reconsider this from the implementors point of view.\r\n\r\n> * SD-JWT has gained a lot of momentum in the past months and there is a lot of \"running code\" already.

One of the recent amendments, while this conversation has been carried, is extension of \"JWS Serialisation\". It doesn't break anything and also touches the SD-JWT.\r\n\r\n",

I mean, by the time you've read the `typ` value of a JWS you've already had to figure out that it's a JWS and whether it's compact serialization or one of the JSON serializations. And, of course, there's the fun fact that a JSON serialized JWS might have more than one 'typ' header and it can show show up in variety of places[2]. \r\n\r\nPreventing JWT confusion attacks with explicit typing is a worthwhile thing. Honestly though, in retrospect, I'm not sure `typ` and media types[3] were the best tool for it. But it's a \"Best Current Practice\" now with a registered `+jwt` structured syntax suffix[4] and several registered media types using it[5]. So it's out there and has some momentum in usage. The SD-JWT compact serialization is similar enough to JWT that it made sense to follow the same pattern/recommendation[6] with a structured syntax suffix registration request for `+sd-jwt`[7].  \r\n\r\nI'm becoming less and less convinced that adding the SD-JWT JWS JSON serialization[8] was necessary or a good idea. But it's there in -05 and that leads us here to this issue. Given that 0...n `typ` headers could appear in a JSON serialized SD-JWT, I don't think it's an appropriate construct to employ for preventing type confusion (if JSON serialized SD-JWTs even need such a construct). And (I think similar to @Sakurann) I am not comfortable advocating for the use of multiple structured suffixes and not at all interested in trying to register one with this draft. Which is to say that `+sd-jwt+json` is a pretty hard \"no\" from me. \r\n\r\nFor use with HTTP header fields like `accept` and `content-type` or other contexts where the media type might be used to say what the thing is or ask for a certain thing, the existing `application/jose+json` media type kinda feels like it'd be sufficient. But I can also see the potential usefulness of a more specific `application/sd-jwt+json` and could maybe be convinced that this draft should request registration of such. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.9 JWS typ\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516#section-4.1.11 JWE typ\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-5.1 JWT typ\r\n\r\n[2] lots of different places typ header(s) could show up \r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-7.2.1 General JWS JSON Serialization \r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-7.2.2 Flattened JWS JSON Serialization\r\n\r\n[3]\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725#name-use-explicit-typing JWT BCP explicit typing\r\n\r\n[4]\r\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml\r\n\r\n[5] (somewhat rhetorical) does `dpop+jwt` really need to be an IANA registered media type? \r\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml\r\n\r\n[6]\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt#name-explicit-typing\r\n\r\n[7]\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt#name-structured-syntax-suffix-re\r\n\r\n[8]\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt#name-jws-json-serialization",

Perhaps I\u2019m missing something here, but why not? It doesn\u2019t seem like it compromises any of the intended security properties. Use of a symmetric MAC may also limit the privacy impacts on users as it provides some measure of deniability (similar to that mentioned in section 12.1), as any Verifier in possession of the secret key could also have produced any claims that are subsequently leaked, allowing the user to deny that they were produced by the supposed Issuer. (This deniability property holds even without subsequent leaking of old signing keys).\r\n\r\n> > [Brian] The thinking behind that was basically that this Issuer-Holder-Verifier model implies/assumes that an Issuer issues a token with no idea of where it\u2019ll be presented and having a shared symmetric key seemed really weird in that situation. Also hard to explain why or how a shared symmetric key would work in that situation too.

If the holder strips off any disclosures, the trailing tilde, and optional KB-JWT, the result is still a valid JWT and the signature would verify, although the token might have some strange claims such as `_sd` and `{\"...\": hash}`. Conversely, the holder could take a traditional JWT and add a tilde, potentially triggering SD-JWT processing (although I can't see any concrete risk here).\r\n\r\nFor me, the best way to resolve this ambiguity would be to modify the signing procedure for an SD-JWT such that the signature would NOT match that of a corresponding JWT, likely by adding something to the plaintext, thus requiring the verifier to be informed about which type of token they are processing.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I believe that adding a standard claim in the SD-JWT protected header could help prevent confusion (`\"_sd\": true` for example).",

This is dangerous (see the second paragraph of https://drafts.oauth.net/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt.html#name-manipulation-of-disclosures).\r\n- The current design in the draft allows to send smaller presentations if only a few claims are disclosed and recursive disclosures are used.\r\n- There is no need to discuss corner cases, for example, where a child element is disclosed, but not the parent element. From my experience, the design the we currently have is slightly easier to implement (fewer special cases).\r\n\r\nIn your proposal, how would you encode the order of elements in an array? Just by the order of digests in `_sd`?\r\n\r\nHow would you disambiguate the (at least two) potential meanings of encountering the two disclosures `\r\n[\"CTCthBCyHMuDlXF9qtY6TA\", [\"addresses\",\"...\",\"postcode\"], \"EC1\"]` and `[\"uKp1B0jI2Ezmuo8EaNRG2Q\",[\"addresses\",\"...\",\"street_address\"], \"EC1\"]`?",

However, if the order inside an array was important you could use an array index after \"...\" for example:\r\n\r\n`[\"CTCthBCyHMuDlXF9qtY6TA\", [\"addresses\",\"...[0]\",\"postcode\"], \"EC1\"]\r\nwhich would be the postcode element in the 1st array value under addresses\r\n\"addresses\": [ {\"postcode\": \"EC1\"}, {}, {}]\r\n\r\nI suspect the \"order is not important\" case is probably more common, so you could still just use \"...\" to mean somewhere in the array.\r\n\r\nRegarding your first three bullet points:\r\n\r\n- I don't think \"the verifier can [construct the claims] without checking hashes\" is very persuasive. If an implementer is going to completely disregard security in a security spec, they would be just as likely to have a finite list of expected claims and if they see one of these tokens assume they know where it goes under the current spec (still ignoring the hashes).\r\n- I also disagree that there are fewer corner cases. (I'll open another issue for the ones that I see for the current design). I think there are several corner cases in both designs and I suspect there are about the same number of them.\r\n- Regarding smaller presentations, I am curious here. If we are optimizing for specific use cases it would be good to understand what those are. Could you share a practical example or two?\r\n\r\nThe other advantage I see is you could have fewer decoy digests if all the values are under a single `_sd`.",

Of course, anybody who writes an SD-JWT implementation for just one use case can skip the hash check. However, it is very hard (or impossible?) to write a generic library supporting the current design while skipping the hash check. This is the beauty of the approach. With the pointer-based approach, nobody needs to check any hash. (I know that is easy to say \"but this is a security spec, everybody should be cautious and whoever doesn't is just careless!\" but that is not how the world works. Mistakes that can be made will be made; it is better to make making mistakes hard.)\r\n\r\nRegarding the size of presentations, an example can be found in the specification in [Section 7.3](https://drafts.oauth.net/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt.html#section-7.3): If `address` is not to be disclosed, only this data needs to be sent:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_sd\": [\r\n    \"HvrKX6fPV0v9K_yCVFBiLFHsMaxcD_114Em6VT8x1lg\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"iss\": \"https://issuer.example.com\",\r\n  \"iat\": 1683000000,\r\n  \"exp\": 1883000000,\r\n  \"sub\": \"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c\",\r\n  \"_sd_alg\": \"sha-256\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this contains only one disclosure digest.

This implies the hash function MUST be preimage resistant, but should also not allow an observer to infer any partial information about the undisclosed content. In the terminology of cryptographic commitment schemes, the hash function MUST be computationally hiding.\r\n> \r\n> The hash function MUST be second-preimage resistant. For any salt and claim value pair, it is infeasible to find a different salt and claim value pair that result in the same digest.\r\n> \r\n> The hash function SHOULD also be collision resistant. Although not essential to the anticipated uses of SD-JWT, without collision resistance an Issuer may be able to find multiple disclosures that have the same hash value. The signature over the SD-JWT would not then commit the Issuer to the contents of the JWT, which is surprising. Where this is a concern, the collision resistance of the hash function SHOULD match the collision resistance of the hash function used by the signature scheme. For example, use of the ES512 signature algorithm would require a disclosure hash function with at least 256-bit collision resistance, such as SHA-512.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

IMHO we don't want to unintentionally prohibit that kind of thing but absolutely need to keep general principle/requirement that a verifier have a validation policy that isn't unduly/unexpectedly influenced by the (sometimes attacker-controllable) content of the token. I'm not sure how to reasonably convey that in the context of the draft as it is. And don't want to make large changes for this. So this issue is a placeholder to look at small refinements to current text that could be perceived as too limiting/strict. And/or maybe adding a short new considerations section about verifier policy that explains that a policy isn't necessarily completely static.  ",

Identify where in the object this hash appears, as an `...` entry in an array element or as a value in an `_sd` hash list.\r\n    3. Restore the redacted value from the disclosure object\r\n        * If in an array, replace the `{ \"...\": ... }` with the value\r\n        * If in an object, add a field with the name and value in the disclosure and remove from `_sd`\r\n",

But if we're going to keep it, we need to elaborate the algorithm.  Maybe it can be folded into the existing recursive algorithm as a termination condition.  If you're adding the hashes inside disclosed values as you restore them, then if you get to the point where none of the claim hashes are in the set of disclosure hashes, then if the set of disclosure hashes is non-empty, the object is invalid.",

Even with the recursion. A validating party needs to compute the lists of (1) hashes of the disclosure objects and has to look at (2) all disclosure hashes in the Issuer JWT (including by recursive inclusion). The only additional step is still just to check that (1) is a subset of (2). Which is basically just checking that there were no unused disclosures at the end of processing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Refer to [Section 11.6](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#key_binding_security) for details.\r\n\r\nThis invites people to write code that is insecure unless the operator writes a policy that corrects for the deficiencies of the code.  As @selfissued points out, when things are structured that way, people will fail to write those policies in a safe way, and you get security defects.\r\n\r\nTo frame it in terms of API design:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# What the document has now\r\ndef verify_sd_jwt(sd_jwt, require_kb)\r\n\r\n# What the document ought to have\r\ndef verify_sd_jwt(sd_jwt) # KB MUST NOT be present\r\ndef verify_sd_jwt_with_key_binding(sd_jwt) # KB MUST be present and valid\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe point being that the `require_kb` flag has significant security implications (much like a putative \"accept `alg:none` flag), so we shouldn't express things in those terms.  You would never write a data import method that is like `import_data(data, signed)`, because the first time someone calls it with `signed=false` in the wrong context, you have a security incident.  Instead, you would write a separate `import_data_raw_danger_danger_danger(data)` method, and be very careful about where you use it.  If an application doesn't care about key binding, it should explicitly transform the SD-JWT to strip it.\r\n\r\nNet of all that ranting, though, all I'm saying here is that we should split the current verification algorithm in two, where one algorithm covers validation of the base SD-JWT properties (issuer JWT valid, all disclosures accounted for), and the other first validates the key binding, then calls the first algorithm.",

But I do agree with Richard that when there is no selective disclosure, it is just a JWT, so the i think it is up to the use-case and implementations to do `JWT~` when they think that that JWT may enter verifiable credential ecosystem where JWTs with selective disclosure are also used and not something for the standard to dictate..

The same is true for W3C credentials, where you can see the payload, and only start hashing/canonicalizing when you want to verify the signature.\r\n\r\nCurrently this makes it harder to separate different parts of processing an SD-JWT (the verification part which requires crypto, and the handling the content part, which often doesn't require crypto), and it either requires storing a copy of the SD-JWT in a way that doesn't require the hashing to construct the payload, or re-constructing the actual payload using hashing each time. \r\n\r\nAs this is more of an implementation detail, I think this may be a fair trade-off for this specification, but something I'm curious about if it has come up in discussions around this specification.",

I haven't filed individual issues yet because I'm not sure how you'll want to group them. Thanks to @OR13 for doing a first pass; any remaining mistakes are probably because I didn't take his advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [5.1. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-5.1)[Issuer-signed JWT Payload](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-issuer-signed-jwt-payload)\r\n\r\n- [x] This should follow https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-7 by specifying \"what serialization and serialization features are used\". I see that 1.1. Feature Summary mentions the compact serialization, but that doesn't clearly say that this embedded JWT uses it.\r\n\r\n## [5.2.1. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-5.2.1)[Disclosures for Object Properties](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-disclosures-for-object-prop)\r\n\r\n- [x] \"The claim name, or key, as it would be used in a regular JWT payload. The value MUST be a string.\" <- I assume the \"value\" is the key, and not the key's value in the JSON object?\r\n- [x] Why is 128 bits only recommended and not required for the salt?\r\n\r\n## [5.3. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-5.3)[Key Binding JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-key-binding-jwt)\r\n\r\n- [x] This should follow https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-7 by specifying \"what serialization and serialization features are used\". I see that 1.1. Feature Summary mentions the compact serialization, but that doesn't clearly say that this embedded JWT uses it.\r\n\r\n## [5.3.1. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-5.3.1)[Integrity Protection of the Presentation](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-integrity-protection-of-the)\r\n\r\n- [x] This mentions \"bytes preceding the KB-JWT in the Presentation\", but several other places mention \"Key Binding is provided by means not defined in this specification\", in which case the relevant bytes don't precede the KB-JWT. These should be consistent.\r\n\r\n## [8.1. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-8.1)[Verification of the SD-JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-verification-of-the-sd-jwt)\r\n\r\n- [x] Are \"Upon receiving an SD-JWT, a Holder or a Verifier MUST ensure that\" and \"The Holder or the Verifier MUST perform the following (or equivalent) steps when receiving an SD-JWT\" accomplishing the same thing?\r\n- [x] \"Separate the SD-JWT\" should cite an algorithm for doing that. I think it's \"5. SD-JWT Data Formats\" which implies it's just \"split on '~'\"?\r\n- [x] \"Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed secure\" <- This should probably be an input to the algorithm \u2026 although I think there are algorithm confusion attacks that imply that the algorithm should actually be picked based on the key the verifier has cached for the issuer rather than the claim in the JWT. I know this hasn't changed compared to JWS, but we know more about how JWS and other cryptography fails, so it'd be good to incorporate modern best practices in the interfaces here.\r\n- [x] \"Validate the signature over the Issuer-signed JWT\" should cite an algorithm for doing that. Is that https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-5.2?\r\n- [x] How should the application \"Validate the Issuer and that the signing key belongs to this Issuer\"? I see that the details of distribution are out of scope (Section 11.9), but this should say something about the application having a map from (issuer ID, key ID) pairs to public keys, and which fields of the Issuer-signed JWT are used to look up keys in this map.\r\n- [x] How should the application \"Check that the _sd_alg claim value is understood\"? Where should it find the _sd_alg, in the JWT's header or payload? 5.1.1. Hash Function Claim answers this, so you could just reference that, but it would be even better to accept a set of acceptable algorithms as an argument, look up the particular field in the payload object, and save that in a variable if it's in the input set.\r\n- [x] What's a \"claim\"? https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4 says the claims are the members of the JWT's payload, but the algorithm here also uses \"claim\" to describe nested object members and array elements.\r\n- [x] I would probably have written the algorithm to build a map of hash->disclosure and then call a recursive element-processing-and-replacing function, but this isn't too bad.\r\n- [x] \"Remove all array elements for which the digest was not found\" probably won't confuse anyone for long, but my first reading said that an array in the payload like [1, 2, 3] would wind up empty since no digests were found for the elements.\r\n- [x] \"Check that the SD-JWT is valid using claims such as nbf, iat, and exp\" should say where those claims are defined and what part of which object they appear on. (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml#claims, and the top level of the payload, not the header, right?)\r\n- [x] The \"required validity-controlling claim\"s should probably be an input parameter to this algorithm. Possibly all the IANA-registered JWT claim handling should be passed in, or this algorithm should return all the claims for the caller to deal with.\r\n\r\n## [8.2. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-8.2)[Processing by the Holder](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-processing-by-the-holder)\r\n\r\n- [x] \"create a Key Binding JWT\" <- refer to the section that says how to do this.\r\n- [x] \"Assemble the SD-JWT for Presentation\" <- This should at least refer to \"5. SD-JWT Data Formats\" and possibly just write out the algorithm of \"make an array of the Issuer-signed JWT, the selected Disclosures and, if applicable, the Key Binding JWT, and join the array with '~'.\"\r\n\r\n## [8.3. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-8.3)[Verification by the Verifier](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-verification-by-the-verifie)\r\n\r\n- [x] This is clearer that \"Verifiers MUST ensure that\" is accomplished by the steps in the following algorithm, but I don't like the redundant MUST. You can just say \"Verifiers need to ensure that\" and then leave the normative requirements to the algorithm.\r\n- [x] \"according to the Verifier's policy\" should be an input parameter to this algorithm, that the verifier provides along with the bytes of the presentation.\r\n- [x] \"verify the Key Binding according to the method used\" <- how? This might be https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449.html#section-6, but you should cite the details.\r\n- [x] \"Determine the public key for the Holder\" <- how? This might be the 'cnf' claim, but you should say so.\r\n- [x] \"Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed secure\" <- as above, this should be an input parameter to this algorithm or computed from the public key.\r\n- [x] \"Validate the signature\" <- again, cite how to do this.\r\n- [x] \"the typ of the Key Binding JWT\" <- is that in the header or payload? (cite 5.3. Key Binding JWT and possibly https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#name-use-explicit-typing)\r\n- [x] \"within an acceptable window.\" <- should be an input parameter\r\n- [x] \"validating nonce and aud claims\" <- The instructions for doing this should be an input parameter to this algorithm.\r\n- [x] \"Check that the Key Binding JWT is valid in all other respects\" should call a particular algorithm from the other specs that it cites.\r\n\r\n## [16. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#section-16)[Informative References](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-06.html#name-informative-references)\r\n\r\n- [x] Many of these should be normative. For example, base64url is used all over the normative parts of this specification, and it comes from [RFC7515] in this section.",

What is the use case of the salt, and how does it help to hide the claim values? \r\n\r\nmy response:\r\n\r\n> I was going to point you to some text in the draft that explains it but unfortunately couldn't find such text. That's maybe something that should be fixed. Sections [10.3](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-08.html#section-10.3) - 10.5  kinda say something about it but the reason is mostly just implied. Basically the salt makes it computationally infeasible to enumerate a potential value space for a claim name/value into the hash function to try and find the matching hash value. Thereby making impossible brute force style attempts to 'reverse' a hash value by hashing all reasonable input values to try and find a match to the hash value. If that makes any sense? To put it another way (which may or may not be helpful), the salt makes it computationally infeasible to guess the preimage of the digest. \r\n\r\nThe exchange makes me think a brief mention/explanation what salt does/provides in the SD-JWT context would be a worthwhile addition. Maybe just add or modify a sentence or two in sec 10.3. And/or something in https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-08.html#section-5.2.1-2.1.2.1 where the salt value in the Disclosure is introduced/described.  ",

I honestly had a hard time giving a good rational for SD-JWT not being more prescriptive with it's requirements here.\r\n\r\nIt seems that using the `cnf` claim exclusively would be more straightforward and much better for interop. \r\n\r\n@bifurcation has previously made similar comments, \"it seems like there's an unnecessary level of ambiguity around how the Issuer-signed JWT binds to a holder public key.  Can we not just say `cnf`?  Why do we need more?  This point actually worries me more than [others] -- without clarity on this, there is no hope of writing stacks that interop.\"\r\n\r\nUsing the `cnf` claim exclusively could also help with some clarity in the [security considerations](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-08.html#section-10.6) where there currently has to be wording like \"[if there's] no recognized Key Binding data is present in the SD-JWT...\" and \" ... the Issuer might have added the key to the SD-JWT in a format/claim that is not recognized by the Verifier.\".\r\n\r\nNote this is related to but separate from the question of if the presence of a `cnf` claim in the issuer-signed JWT means that the verifier should have to require a KB-JWT. The `cnf` claim can be made _the way_ to do holder binding while still leaving that up to verifier policy.\r\n\r\n",

However, we did consider the approaches similar to the ones you propose when designing the array feature, but we decided against it in the end. If I remember correctly, the reasons were:\r\n\r\n- It is not clear how that would work with nested arrays. Admittedly, that might be a super-rare use case. But with the current option, we can confidently say that we can selectively disclose any element in a JWT payload, independent of its type or where it is nested.\r\n- Related, the mental model behind the current approach aligns with what we have for the key/value disclosures: You find the digest where the original element would be; not a level higher. I found this much easier to implement, as it works nicely with a simple recursion; when processing the array, I don't need any \"outside\" information. \r\n- I found it slightly harder to describe all potential pitfalls and problems when parsing the structure you propose, e.g.: What if a claim name already exists as an object? What if a number is given twice?\r\n\r\nNone of these are a really \"hard\" reason to do it they way we do today; but neither is the typing problem a reason not to do it.",

      "body": "We (Guido Schmitz and Alex Hodder-Williams) have been working on producing a formal analysis of the current specification. We will share more details about this analysis soon, but wanted to point out some observations.\r\n\r\nDuring the issuance phase, it is unclear to us how the holder gets guarantees regarding the entire set of disclosures that verify under the received issuer-signed JWT.\r\nAs specified: the holder should accept an issuance if the signature verifies, and the received set of disclosures all verify according to this SD-JWT presentation. However, the holder doesn't have guarantees that the digests in the issuer-signed JWT that they didn't receive a corresponding disclosure for are in fact decoy digests. These digests could contain other disclosures, which the holder would be unaware of. This would allow colluding issuers and verifiers to create a non-interactive covert channel, where the verifiers are looking for a specific digest. This seems to relate to 11.1 in the specification, but may be worth additional discussion in the document.\r\n\r\nOne possible technical solution could look as follows:\r\n- The holder provides the issuer with a set of nonces that can be used as decoy digests.\r\n- The issuer must then hash these nonces (this prevents the holder from inserting their own non-issued claims)\r\n- The holder can then check if the digests they don't receive disclosures for match their original nonces.\r\nClearly this adds overhead and slightly complicates the standard, however, it is our view that the holder of a credential that has been issued to (and potentially about) them, should have full knowledge of what could be contained in that credential.\r\n\r\nAnother issue stemming from decoy digests, with a different consequence, is that if disclosures get dropped off the end of an SD-JWT presentation in the issuance phase, yet the presentation still verifies, the holder won't ever have the full set of disclosures, but will be unaware that they are missing information.\r\nThis may be mitigated at a different level. Any kind of authenticated channel between the issuer and holder prevents tampering of the initial set of disclosures. This may be out of scope of the SD-JWT document as it is likely to be protocol specific; but again, this might be worth including a remark about.\r\n",

While what you describe is a potential way an Issuer could hide information, the Issuer could do the same in the salt values used in the disclosures.

So I don't think that it would be worth designing a solution to avoid this kind of side channel.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second point, I agree that this could be remarked somewhere.

      "body": "The fifth paragraph mentions:\r\n\r\n>   To prevent attacks in which an SD-JWT is presented to a Verifier\r\n   without the Holder's consent, this specification additionally defines\r\n   a mechanism for binding the SD-JWT to a key under the control of the\r\n   Holder (Key Binding).  When Key Binding is enforced, a Holder has to\r\n   prove possession of a private key belonging to a public key contained\r\n   in the SD-JWT itself.  It usually does so by signing over a data\r\n   structure containing transaction-specific data, herein defined as the\r\n   Key Binding JWT.  An SD-JWT with a Key Binding JWT is called SD-\r\n   JWT+KB in this specification.\r\n\r\nKey Binding is not performed to prevent attacks without the \"Holder's consent\". \r\n\r\nKey binding will be ineffective if the End-User consents to perform a collaborative attack against a Verifier \r\nfor the profit of another individual by performing all the cryptographic operations that the other individual needs \r\n... unless the Holder supports specific characteristics that are able to prevent such collaborative attacks. \r\n\r\nOnce again, a Holder is an *application*, i.e., it is not a human being. \r\n\r\nKey Binding only demonstrates the **use** of a private key corresponding to a public key contained in a SD-JWT. \r\nIt does not demonstrate the *possession* of a key. \r\n\r\nA key binding is performed (a) when requesting a SD-JWT to an Issuer, while (b) the demonstration of that key binding \r\nis performed to a Verifier at the presentation time.\r\n\r\nReplace by:\r\n   \r\n\r\n>    When requesting a digital credential to an Issuer, the Holder CAN \r\n>    demonstrate to the Issuer that the request originates from an \r\n>    application that supports specific characteristics. In that case, \r\n>    the Holder CAN include in his request a public key and demonstrate \r\n>    to the Issuer the use of the corresponding private key.\r\n\r\n>   The Issuer CAN include in the SD-JWT a claim that indicates \r\n>   the Holder characteristics: \"hcahr\" (for **_h_**older **_char_**acteristics).\r\n\r\n>    When presenting a SD-JWT + Sel.Claims to a verifier, the Holder CAN \r\n>    then add a key-binding JWT, called KB-JWT, that allows to integrity \r\n>    protect the \"SD-JWT + Sel.Claims\" structure. In this way, the \r\n>    Verifier will be able to verify that the \"SD-JWT + Sel.Claims\" \r\n>    structure and the KB-JWT \" originate from a Holder that supports \r\n>    specific characteristics.\r\n>    \r\n>    The strength of the key binding is dependent upon the characteristics \r\n>    of the Holder.  Such characteristics include the generation of \r\n>    key pairs, their protection as well as additional characteristics in \r\n>    particular to demonstrate its ability to counter collaborative or \r\n>    collusions attacks between End-Users\r\n\r\nUnless the Verifier is able to know the characteristics of the Holder by using *information present in the SD-JWT*, \r\nthe key binding mechanism can be easily defeated. The claim that shall be placed into the SD-JWT is currently missing \r\nand should be added. This new claim could be called \"hcahr\".\r\n",

Unlinkability\r\n> \r\n>    Unlinkability is a property whereby one or more Verifiers are \r\n>    prevented from correlating SD-JWT presentations from the same Holder.\r\n>    Without unlinkability, a Verifier might be able to learn more about \r\n>    the End-User intended to disclose, for example:\r\n> \r\n>    *  A single Verifier might want to count the number of accesses made \r\n>       by one Holder.\r\n> \r\n>    *  Collaborative Verifiers might want to learn that the same End-User \r\n>       made an access to their services.\r\n> \r\n>    In all cases, unlinkability is limited to cases where the disclosed\r\n>    claims do not contain information that directly or indirectly\r\n>    identifies the End-User.  For example, when a taxpayer identification\r\n>    number is contained in the disclosed claims, the Issuer and Verifier\r\n>    can easily link the user's transactions.  However, when the End-User\r\n>    only discloses a birth date to one Verifier and a postal code to \r\n>    another Verifier, the two Verifiers should not be able to determine \r\n>    that they were interacting with the same End-User.\r\n> \r\n>    The following types of unlinkability are considered here:\r\n>    *  Single Verifier Unlinkability: incapability of one Verifier to \r\n>       learn that it got two or more accesses using different sessions \r\n>       from the same End-User or the same Holder.\r\n> \r\n>    *  Verifier/Verifier Unlinkability: incapability of two or more \r\n>       collaborative Verifiers to learn that they got accesses from \r\n>       the same End-User or from the same Holder.\r\n>       These collaborative Verifiers may wish to know whether they got an \r\n>       access from the same End-User, without necessarily being able to \r\n>       identify him. \r\n>       Independently from the set of disclosed claims, one or more fields \r\n>       from the SD-JWT or of the KB-JWT may reveal that they relate either \r\n>       to the same the End-User or to the same Holder, and hence to the \r\n>       same End-User.  In that case, if a first Verifier is able to \r\n>       identify the End-User and collaborates with a second Verifier \r\n>       which was unable to identifier the End-User, then the second \r\n>       Verifier will be able to identify the End-User.\r\n> \r\n>    Single Verifier Unlinkability and Verifier/Verifier unlinkability \r\n>    can be implemented using batch issuance:  a batch of SD-JWTs based on the\r\n>    same set of claims is issued to the Holder instead of just a single\r\n>    SD-JWT.

I\r\nwould like to know what your motivation is for these drafts (I see you have\r\ndone the same on the SD-JWT-VC draft).  It sort of looks like comment spam.\r\nI realize that you are a long-time participant in the IETF, and you\r\nobviously have your \u2018style\u2019.   Once I understand your motivation, then we\r\ncan work towards that goal.\r\n\r\nI will also say that if a particular draft doesn\u2019t suit your needs, then it\r\nis always possible for you to author a draft and support it through the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nBelow are both my general comments, and then blow by blow responses to your\r\n42 issues.\r\n\r\nDeb Cooley\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy general comments on the issues:\r\n\r\n1.      End-User comments: These are implementation choices.  Holder is\r\nbasically the front for all sorts of different implementation options. Any\r\nimplementation can be constructed to be secure, or insecure.  The format\r\n(this draft) doesn\u2019t control that.  There are many comments that are\r\nfocused on the End-User vs Holder discussion.  See Daniel\u2019s explanation\r\nhere:\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/oauth/o_GsCqflyoA-Kd4ZCg5QlYy_tdQ/ .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.      Comments on Introductory material: In my opinion, the introduction\r\nneeds to be clear, concise, and straightforward.  Adding complexity doesn\u2019t\r\nhelp \u2018set the stage\u2019 for the detail part of the draft.  There are many\r\ncomments on the Intro text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.      Organization of the draft: Choices are made by authors about where\r\nto put the detail.  If that detail does in fact exist already in the draft,\r\ncomments asking for it to be repeated or moved MUST have good rationale.  There\r\nare several comments like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.      Editorial comments: I agree these should be easy to fix, but if one\r\ninsists on burying the lead, i.e. putting the editorial comments in the\r\nmidst of other comments, then they are easy to miss.  I have put \u2018*\u2019 by the\r\neditorial comments I want the authors to fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.      Age examples: This points to ongoing work in this area.  Martin\r\nThomson has a blog:\r\nhttps://lowentropy.net/posts/selective-disclosure/ .  Salted\r\nhash-based selective disclosure might not be the perfect answer for this\r\nparticular use case.  But it is fine for other use cases.  My comment here\r\nis to not let perfect be the enemy of good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.      Security Considerations: I am going to ask for some additions here.\r\nNot that the draft needs to address these items, just to make clear that\r\nthey must be done correctly and are out of scope for this particular draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.      PQ algorithms: This draft does not address algorithms at all, they\r\npoint to JOSE where the algorithms will be specified.  There could be a\r\nnote in the Security Considerations section, if the authors so desire.\r\n\r\n -------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLine numbers that I reference are from idnits.  The list of issues is below\r\nwith my comments:\r\n\r\n   - #498 Figure 1 should be corrected to take into account the existence\r\n   of an End-user and to consider KB-JWT instead of KB\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/498>\r\n\r\n*Lines 268-297: The addition of the End-User implies implementation.  WRT\r\nthe holder to Verifiers text, I would suggest \u2018Presents SD-JWT or SD-JWT+KB\r\nincluding selected Disclosures\u2019 to account for the KB-JWT.\r\n\r\n   - #497 The term End-User should be added to the definitions\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/497>\r\n\r\nLines 220-266: Given the term \u2018end-user\u2019 does not occur within the draft, I\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n   - #496 The definition of a Verifier would need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/496>\r\n\r\nLines 265-266: I thought providing all disclosures was an option?  The\r\ncurrent definition is clearer and more complete.\r\n\r\n   - #495 The definition of an Holder would need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/495>\r\n\r\nLines 261-264: The suggestion is pertinent for one possible implementation\r\nof the format.  Keeping the format language clear and concise is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - #494 The definition of an Issuer would need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/494>\r\n\r\nLine 260: This seems superfluous, again language needs to be clear and\r\nconcise.\r\n\r\n   - #493 The definition of a \"key binding JWT\" would need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/493>\r\n\r\n*Lines 253-256: I would reorder the sentences in the definition where the\r\nlast sentence is \u2018The details of how a JWT for proving Key Binding is\r\ndefined in Section 4.3.\u2019  (putting the second sentence first).  Certainly,\r\ndetails and requirements of how this is done is not suitable for a\r\nterminology section.\r\n\r\n   - #492 The definition of \"key binding\" would need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/492>\r\n\r\n*Lines 248-252: I agree that \u2018legitimate possession\u2019 isn\u2019t quite right (nor\r\nprovable).  I suggest removing the word \u2018legitimate\u2019.  As for implications\r\nthat the construction of the system w/ one or more end-users that utilize a\r\nsingle holder is out of scope.  This draft is merely the format, not the\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n   - #491 The definition of the Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT) would\r\n   need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/491>\r\n\r\nLines 237-241: \u2018zero or more\u2019 includes \u2018all\u2019.  It makes it very difficult\r\nto implement if requirements are buried in terminology sections.  No\r\nchanges required.\r\n\r\n   - #490 The definition of the SD-JWT+KB structure needs to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/490>\r\n\r\nLine 217-218: Still Introduction.  The details of how the format works is\r\nin Section 4.3.\r\n\r\n   - #489 A (KB-JWT) does not demonstrate a \"proof of possession\" of\r\n   private key\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/489>\r\n\r\n*Line 215: Still Introduction, the authors could add the word \u2018allow\u2019,\r\nsince a format itself does not prove possession of the private key.\r\n\r\n   - #485 Key binding will be ineffective unless the SD-JWT includes an\r\n   additional claim that indicates the Holder characteristics: \"hcahr\"\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/485>\r\n\r\nLines 182-190: Introduction text needs to be clear and concise.  Details of\r\nhow the format/mechanism is designed are in Section 4.3.  In addition, this\r\nfeature appears to me to be very much like a certificate validate used in\r\nTLS to prove the server (or client) is in possession of the private key.\r\n\r\nI would disagree with your first statement (that is exactly what key\r\nbinding is for).\r\n\r\nOne can quibble about whether use of a private key equates to possession,\r\nbut that is not useful in an introduction.\r\n\r\nThe holder must prove it possesses the private key to the issuer, and then\r\nto the verifier when the claim is presented.\r\n\r\nNone of this text belongs in an introduction.\r\n\r\n   - #488 What is a \"facility for associating an SD-JWT with a key pair\" ?\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/488>\r\n\r\n*Line 214: I don\u2019t think \u2018facility\u2019 here means \u2018a physical place\u2019.  I do\r\nthink the Authors could pick a better word.  Maybe \u2018ability\u2019?\r\n\r\n   - #487 Difference between \"a format extending the JWS Compact\r\n   Serialization\" and \"an alternate format extending the JWS JSON\r\n   Serialization\" ?\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/487>\r\n\r\nLines 203-208: It is unclear to me what is unclear here.  Section 8\r\ndescribes the alternate format.  The rest of the draft describes the\r\nprimary format.  Section 1.1 is still Introduction.\r\n\r\n   - #486 The structure called \"SD-JWT+KB\" should be renamed \"SD-JWT+KB-JWT\"\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/486>\r\n\r\nAssuming lines 189-190: There is no loss of clarity as it is currently\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n   - #484 A Holder does not present a \"JWT\" to a Verifier but \"SD-JWT +\r\n   Sel.Claims\"\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/484>\r\n\r\nAssuming lines 159-161: Again, this is still the Introduction.  Using\r\nconsistent wording is going to be easier for a developer to\r\nunderstand.  Introducing\r\nterms like \u2018talking to\u2019 is confusing.  If the Holder is the End-User does\r\nthat actually speak to the verifier?\r\n\r\n   - #483 Indicate that \"claims\" refers either to object properties\r\n   (name/value pairs) and to array elements\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/483>\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me which part of the Introduction this comment is\r\nreferencing, but the supplied text makes the Introduction more complex.  The\r\ndetails of what a claim can consist of should be in the body of the draft,\r\nnot the Introduction.\r\n\r\n   - #482 Make a difference between the Holder which is an *application*\r\n   and the individual (i.e. End-User)\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/482>\r\n\r\nAssuming you are referring to lines 156-158, this is made clear in the\r\nterminology section definition of Holder.\r\n\r\n   - #522 The last paragraph of section 10.5 (Issuer Identifier) can be\r\n   removed\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/522>\r\n\r\nGiven my comment on the previous issue (#521), this one is OBE.\r\n\r\n   - #521 A new section about \"Issuer anonymity\" should be added\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/521>\r\n\r\nThe current Section 10.5 gives a mitigation.  Some entity has to be\r\naccountable.  It is extremely difficult to hold an anonymous entity\r\naccountable.\r\n\r\n   - #520 Section 10.3 (Confidentiality during Transport) should also\r\n   mention integrity\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/520>\r\n\r\nThe SD-JWT itself is signed, which handles the integrity requirement.  In\r\naddition, modern TLS implementations provide Confidentiality and Integrity\r\nby default.\r\n\r\n   - #519 Since claims always contain privacy-sensitive data section 10.2\r\n   would need to be reworded\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/519>\r\n\r\nSince this is a \u2018SHOULD NOT\u2019, it leaves the option for other actions.\r\n\r\n   - #518 Holders SHOULD NOT be required to store SD-JWTs \"only in\r\n   encrypted form\"\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/518>\r\n\r\nThe statement is a SHOULD, it leaves the option for other protection as an\r\noption.\r\n\r\n   - #517 Section 10.2 should be made more general to consider both the\r\n   storage of signed and un-signed data\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/517>\r\n\r\nIt is appropriate for this draft to handle SD-JWT data.  It is completely\r\nobvious that unsigned sensitive data should be protected.  No need for that\r\nto be specified here.\r\n\r\n   - #515 The term \"unlinkability\" is overloaded. For more clarity, the\r\n   wording \"End-user intrackability\" should be used in addition\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/515>\r\n\r\nNo action.  Making up new terms here isn\u2019t terribly useful.\r\n\r\n   - #516 A new section about \"End-User intrackability\" should be added\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/516>\r\n\r\nHow end-users interact with Holders (and every other part of this) is an\r\nimplementation detail.  SD-JWT is merely the format.\r\n\r\n   - #514 A section should be added to consider the case of a presentation\r\n   of claims to Verifier that have been issued by different Issuers\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/514>\r\n\r\nThis looks like an implementation decision to me.  The SD-JWT draft\r\nspecifies the format, how it is used is determined by the implementation.\r\n\r\n   - #513 Section 9.5 (Key Binding) needs to be revised to consider the\r\n   case of a collusion between End-Users\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/513>\r\n\r\n*This is an implementation issue.  Only one point do I agree with \u2013\r\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 is not provable.  It should merely be removed from the section.\r\n\r\n   - #512 Section 7.3 needs to be revised to describe which data structures\r\n   can be transmitted\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/512>\r\n\r\nSection 7.3: As this section stands, the terminology is correct.\r\n\r\n   - #507 It is important to mention the use of decoy digests and of the\r\n   shuffling of the digests included in the SD-JWT payload\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/507>\r\n\r\nSection 4.2.1 and 4.2.2: It is unclear why one would include this text\r\nbefore Section 4.2.5, where decoy digests are discussed.  In addition, this\r\nguidance appears to be better applied to a specific implementation.\r\n\r\n   - #511 The requirement for an Issuer of not providing a SD-JWT+KB-JWT\r\n   should be removed\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/511>\r\n\r\nLines 1521-1522: It is up to an implementation to determine where the key\r\nbinding key pair is generated.  In the case that the Issuer issues it, then\r\nit is wise for the Holder to verify that it has received just the SD-JWT\r\n(in this case, the private/public key pair has to be transmitted to the\r\nholder, but that is out of scope for this draft).  In the case that the\r\nHolder, or other entity generates the key pair, then it is less likely that\r\nthe Issuer could construct the KB-JWT.  It is still a trivial check and\r\nworth doing for completeness.\r\n\r\n   - #510 Verification steps for the KB-JWT are missing in section 7.1\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/510>\r\n\r\nSection 7.1: Right, they are in Section 7.3 (as stated in Section 4.3).\r\n\r\n   - #509 Validation steps for the KB-JWT are missing\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/509>\r\n\r\nLines 880-893: As stated in the section, the verification steps and details\r\nare located in Section 7.3.\r\n\r\n   - #508 The iat time at which the Key Binding JWT was issued should not\r\n   be REQUIRED\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/508>\r\n\r\nLines 850-852: I disagree.  Depending on how long a nonce is kept by the\r\nsystem that generates it, the time that the KB JWT was issued allows\r\nanother option to prevent replay.\r\n\r\n   - #506 How the Holder key pair is established cannot be placed \"out of\r\n   the scope of this document\"\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/506>\r\n\r\n*Lines 534-538: I believe this is Section 4.1.2: Better to list this as\r\n\u2018out of scope\u2019 than to do a half way job of laying out the requirements.\r\nNote:  the replacement text has nothing close to the list of requirements\r\nthat would need to be levied to ensure secure key pair generation, let\r\nalone how those key pairs are handled, stored, and maintained from birth to\r\ndeath.  Again, this is a format, not an implementation.  This should be\r\nadded to security considerations (if it is not already there).\r\n\r\n   - #505 Add an example of using arrays for \"age_over\" and \"age_under\"\r\n   claims\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/505>\r\n\r\nSection 4.2.2: The appendices are a better place for these.  I believe\r\nthere are some examples there already.\r\n\r\n   - #504 It would be worth to mention that the Issuer decides which claims\r\n   are always disclosed\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/504>\r\n\r\nLines 489-490: This comment makes the text repetitive (either by the\r\nnumbered list above this or that para after.\r\n\r\n   - #503 The description of the SD-JWT+KB is confusing\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/503>\r\n\r\nLines 380-382: Note: this comment was addressed in Github\r\n\r\n   - #502 The description of the SD-JWT can be improved\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/502>\r\n\r\nLines 375-376: Is the issue whether zero Disclosures is appropriate?  If\r\nso, why?  The comment doesn\u2019t state a reason.\r\n\r\n   - #501 The benefits of the nonce and of the audience value can be made\r\n   more accurate\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/501>\r\n\r\nLines 348-350: Where the nonce comes from is an implementation detail (it\r\nis listed as out of scope in Section 4.3).   Draft 14 has \u2018verifier\u2019 in\r\nplace of \u2018audience\u2019 already.\r\n\r\n   - #500 The data elements sent to the Verifier are not correctly defined\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/500>\r\n\r\nLines 327-331: Note there is only one para, and one sentence.  It is\r\nunclear where the commenter wants the change made.   [The addition of\r\nend-user implies implementation.]\r\n\r\n   - #499 The format used to carry both the SD-JWT and the Disclosures is\r\n   unclear\r\n   <https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/499>\r\n\r\n*Lines 318-320:  This can be easily clarified by changing \u2018Holder as part\r\nof the SD-JWT\u2019 to \u2018Holder with the SD-JWT\u2019\r\n\r\n\u00b7         #529  43. Update of Issue #514 (new section 9.12) for the support\r\nof Post Quantum cryptography #529\r\n        https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/pull/529\r\n\r\nThis draft does not specify the selection of the algorithm used for signing\r\neither SD-JWT or SD-JWT-KB.  It does point to \u201cdigital signature algorithm\r\nidentifier\u201d such as per IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms\r\nregistry, and it does specify that it MUST NOT be \u2018NONE\u2019.  When the JOSE\r\nworking group specifies post quantum signature algorithms, then they will\r\nbe available to be used to sign SD-JWT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Nov 27, 2024 at 1:56\u202fPM Denis [<denis.ietf@free.fr>](mailto:&lt;denis.ietf@free.fr&gt;) wrote:\r\n\r\n> Dear Security Area Director,\r\n>\r\n> Please consider this email as a Formal appeal acc.

Presentation of claims issued by different Issuers\r\n\r\n9.12.1 Using conventional cryptography\r\n\r\n    There exist use cases where claims issued by different Issuers need\r\n    to be presented to one Verifier. For example, an End-User would like\r\n    to demonstrate to a Verifier that that he lives in California using\r\n    a SD-JWT issued by a governmental organization and that he got a\r\n    specific diploma using a SD-JWT issued by a University.\r\n\r\n    When there is a need to demonstrate to a Verifier that two SD-JWTs\r\n    have been issued to the same End-User, the Holder can generate a one-time\r\n    key pair and use the same private key to request a SD-JWT from each\r\n    Issuer.\r\n\r\n    The two issued SD-JWTs will contain the same public key and, using\r\n    the corresponding private key, the Holder will be able to demonstrate\r\n    to one Verifier that the two presentations of the two SD-JWTs originate\r\n    from the same Holder.\r\n\r\n    Verifiers MUST be able to obtain the characteristics of the Holder\r\n    to be confident that Holder indeed supports this scheme in a secure way.\r\n\r\n    Since that key pair will only be used once towards a single Verifier,\r\n    a linkage between different collaborative Verifiers using the framing\r\n    of the SD-JWT will not be possible.\r\n\r\n    This scheme mandates to the generation of batches of one-time use SD-JWTs.\r\n\r\n9.12.1 Using Post-Quantum resistant cryptography\r\n\r\n    The technique previously described uses conventional cryptography which is not \r\n    Post-Quantum resistant. Hash-Based signature schemes are believed to be \r\n    Post-Quantum resistant. \r\n\r\n    Their security depends on the infeasibility of finding a preimage or a second preimage. \r\n\r\n    In 1979, Leslie Lamport invented the first One-Time Signatures (OTS) scheme \r\n    that was named the \"Lamport Signature\". Since then, many variations appeared. \r\n\r\n    Among them, the Winternitz OTS (W-OTS) scheme that allows small verification key sizes \r\n    and a trade-of between the signature size and the signature generation time.\r\n\r\n    OTS schemes have a major constrain ... which is not a constrain in the context of a Holder: \r\n    the private key of a key pair shall only be used once.

These steps should be moved from 7.1 to 7.3. If the Holder does not have all the disclosures, they shouldn't use the SD-JWT. It is meaningless to say the Holder *removes* array elements and `_sd` keys from the payload, (because they can't send a payload to the Verifier without these elements). The Holder also cannot check for kleptographic attacks where the  Issuer and Verifier collude.\r\n\r\nI don't see why we would argue about a). It is probably a single sentence in 7.2, something like: \"The Holder verifies that the disclosures it receives from the Issuer are acceptable to the Holder.\" If the policy of the Holder is that any disclosure asserted by the Issuer is ok, then it is still complying with the sentence. However it is an important reminder that there is something important to check here. The idea that the Holder may not always and completely trust the Issuer will be new to many readers.",

So, that means, that, in step (2), you have to parse the `sd-jwt` but *also* keep the original base64url encoded value of the jwt, because you can't reconstruct it from a parsed structure.\r\n\r\nBeing opinionated about how JSON serialization is done (e.g. requiring the removal of whitespace) would make (i think) the parsing invertible and solve this problem.\r\n\r\nApologies for not being able to articulate this more clearly, but wanted to send this out in case someone is able to spot something wrong I might be doing while implementing a parser.\r\n\r\nThe environment in which I'm doing this is likely way more convoluted than an average holder , so it is also possible that even if this is a problem it could be marked as \"not important enough because there are very few holders would run into this being a problem\".",

For example, the Holder MAY create a key pair and provide a public key to the Issuer, the Issuer MAY create the key pair for the Holder, or Holder and Issuer MAY use pre-established key material.\r\n\r\nLet us keep these sentences unchanged.\r\n\r\nNow, let us pull on the thread from the right end. \r\n\r\nSection 4 (Security Considerations) from [RFC7800] mentions that \"possessing a key is only valuable if it is kept secret.  Appropriate means must be used to ensure that unintended parties do not learn private key\".\r\n\r\nIt is important to recall a definition for a private key from ISO/IEC 9798-1:\r\n\r\n> private key\r\n> key of an entity's asymmetric key pair that is kept secret and that should only be *used* by that entity\r\n> \r\n> [SOURCE: ISO/IEC 9798-1:2010, 3.22]\r\n\r\nThe key sentences from RFC 7800 are true, but are restricted. They concentrate of the *protection* and the *knowledge* of the private key but they do not consider the *use* of the private key.\r\n\r\nA smart card user can *use* of private present in his smart card but will never be able to know its value.\r\n\r\nA difference should be made between :\r\n1) the description of the cryptographic mechanism and\r\n2) what can be achieved using this mechanism which is conditional on \"appropriate means that MUST be used to ensure that unintended parties do not learn private key\".\r\n\r\nThe proposed rewordings of this draft have been carefully thought to refer first to the description of the data elements that are needed and exchanged, while the 'proof of possession' concept has been separately addressed and expanded.\r\n\r\nWhen considering threats that can reduce to nothing the effectiveness of this cryptographic (\"binding\") mechanism, there is the need to consider the presence of End-Users, that come in addition to Holders which are applications running using some hardware (and usually also using an OS). \r\n\r\nAn Holder cannot \"give its consent\", but an End-user (i.e. a human being) can. Attacks can be performed either without or with the End-user consent. Hence there is the need to : \r\n(1) use the term \"End-User\" and \r\n(2) make a difference between the term \"Holder\" (application) and the term \"End-User\".\r\n\r\nThe way to address the problem of the appraisal of the effectiveness of the Key Binding mechanism is to recognize that it is outside the scope of this document to specify how Verifiers can know whether appropriate means are effectively used to ensure that unintended parties do not learn the value of the private keys or whether the private keys that are supposed to be under the control of the Holder cannot be used for the benefit of other End-Users (with or without the End-User consent).\r\n\r\nWhen proposing revised text, terms like 'ensure', 'legitimate Holder' or 'prove possession' that were present in this draft have been avoided. Hence, the following two sentences have not been retained:\r\n\r\n> Key Binding aims to ensure that the presenter of an SD-JWT credential is actually the legitimate Holder of the credential. \r\n> The Verifier requires that the Holder prove possession of that private key when presenting the SD-JWT credential.\r\n",

      "body": "The first sentence which uses the word \"legitimate\" is inappropriate:\r\n\r\n> Key Binding aims to ensure that the presenter of an SD-JWT credential is actually the legitimate Holder of the credential.\r\n\r\nThe third sentence uses the wording \"prove possession\" which should be avoided:\r\n\r\n> The Verifier requires that the Holder prove possession of that private key when presenting the SD-JWT credential.\r\n\r\nAs said earlier, it is important to make the difference between :\r\n(1) the description of the cryptographic mechanism and \r\n(2) what can really be achieved using this mechanism which is conditional to other characteristics which are out of the scope of this document.\r\n\r\nBefore proposing a rewriting for Section 9.5 on Key Binding, the following text has been reviewed and after analysis, it is proposed to remove it.\r\n\r\n> It is important that a Verifier does not make its security policy decisions based on data that can be influenced by an attacker. For this reason, when deciding whether Key Binding is required or not, Verifiers MUST NOT take into account whether the Holder has provided an SD-JWT+KB or a bare SD-JWT, since otherwise an attacker could strip the KB-JWT from an SD-JWT+KB and present the resulting SD-JWT. Furthermore, Verifiers should be aware that Key Binding information may have been added to an SD-JWT in a format that they do not recognize and therefore may not be able to tell whether the SD-JWT supports Key Binding or not. If a Verifier determines that Key Binding is required for a particular use case and the Holder presents either a bare SD-JWT or an SD-JWT+KB with an invalid Key Binding JWT, then the Verifier will reject the presentation when following the verification steps described in Section 7.3.\r\n> \r\n> If a SD-JWT contains a public key, then this means that a KB-JWT must also be present. If the KB-JWT has been stripped, then the Verifier must refuse it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following rewording is proposed:\r\n\r\n> An SD-JWT compatible with Key Binding contains a public key, or a reference to a public key, that corresponds to a private key from a key pair. \r\n> \r\n> Without Key Binding, a Verifier only gets the proof that the credential was issued by a particular Issuer, but the credential itself can be replayed by anyone who gets access to it. This means that, for example, after a credential was leaked to an attacker, the attacker can present the credential to any verifier that does not require a binding. But also a malicious Verifier to which the Holder presented the credential can present the credential to another Verifier if that other Verifier does not require Key Binding. \r\n> \r\n> With Key Binding, a Verifier gets the proof that the private key which corresponds to the public key placed in the SD-JWT has been correctly used.\r\n> \r\n> Verifiers MUST decide whether Key Binding is required for a particular use case before verifying a credential. This decision can be informed by various factors including, but not limited to the following: business requirements, the use case, the type of binding between a Holder and its credential that is required for a use case, the sensitivity of the use case, the expected properties of a credential, the type and contents of other credentials expected to be presented at the same time, etc.\r\n> \r\n> If Key Binding is required, then the Verifier must verify that the SD-JWT that is presented contains a public key and that a KB-JWT is also present.\r\n\r\n> Section 4 (Security Considerations) from [RFC7800] indicates that possessing a key is only valuable if it is kept secret.  Appropriate means must be used to ensure that unintended parties do not learn private key.\r\n> \r\n> The key sentences from RFC 7800 are true, but are restricted. They concentrate of the *protection* and the *knowledge* of the private key but they do not consider the *use* of the private key.\r\n> \r\n> It is important to recall a definition for a private key from ISO/IEC 9798-1:\r\n> \r\n> private key\r\n> key of an entity's asymmetric key pair that is kept secret and that should only be *used* by that entity\r\n> \r\n> [SOURCE: ISO/IEC 9798-1:2010, 3.22] \r\n\r\n> Using the current content of a SD-JWT, Verifiers are unable to appraise the effectiveness of the Key Binding mechanism.  It is outside the scope of this document to specify how Verifiers can know whether appropriate means are effectively used to ensure that unintended parties do not learn the value of the private keys or whether the private keys that are supposed to be under the control of the Holder cannot be used for the benefit of other End-Users, with or without the End-User consent.\r\n> \r\n> 9.5.1 Attacks performed with the End-user consent\r\n> \r\n> If two End-Users accept to collaborate, one End-User can perform cryptographic computations for the benefit of another End-User. An example scenario is as follows: one End-user connects to a Verifier and receives back a challenge and a list of claim types that need to be presented to get an access. That End-User forwards to another End-User the challenge received from the Verifier, the name of the Verifier and the set of claim types and values that it wishes to present to the Verifier. It receives back from the other End-User the data structure that he needs to get an access to that Verifier and so the End-User can present it to the Verifier and gets the access.\r\n> \r\n> For example, an application specifically downloaded by the End-User can perform cryptographic computations for the benefit of another End-User, if it is able to use the private keys. As another example, impersonation of the End-User can be achieved if private keys can be exported with the End-user consent and used by another End-User.\r\n> \r\n> 9.5.2 Attacks performed without the End-user consent\r\n> \r\n> A malicious application would be able to use the private keys intended to be used by the Holder or be able to trick the key pair generation process used by the Holder. \r\n> \r\n> As an example, if the private key is only protected by software, a virus would be able use the private key without the End-User being aware of it. Alternatively, the key pair generation process could be modified, so that the generated key pair can be known by malicious application and then exported.\r\n> ",

The Verifier will use the time indicated \nin the SD-JWT to verify first whether it fits into a time window, and then whether the random number has already been received during the time window.\n\nIn this draft, both cases are supported by a single claim: the 'nonce' claim. This is confusing.\n\nThe text has been modified to make it clearer. It defines another claim name called 'chal', when a challenge is generated by the Verifier; \nand it uses two claims ('iat' & 'rnd'), when a nonce mechanism is used by the Holder.\n\nTo summarize:\n- in the first case, only a 'chal' claim is REQUIRED,\n- in the second case, both a 'iat' claim and a 'rnd' claim are REQUIRED.\n\nSince the upper sentence states:\n\n> The Key Binding JWT MUST be a JWT according to [RFC7519] and its payload MUST contain the following elements:\n\nthis sentence and the statements placed below should be reconsidered.\n\nProposed change:\n```\n\n4.3.

The Verifier MUST memorize both the challenge \nand a time-window during which the challenge has been sent. When the Holder receives the challenge, if it accepts to use his mechanism, \nit MUST copy the challenge into the KB-JWT.\n\nFor using the nonce mechanism, the Holder MUST generate a nonce so that the risk of a collision with another nonce generated \nexactly at the same time by another Holder will be very low. The nonce includes two elements: the time at which the KB-JWT has been issued \nand a random number.\n\nThe Key Binding JWT MUST be a JWT according to [RFC7519] and its payload contains the following elements:\n\n   *  in the JOSE header,\n\n      -  typ: REQUIRED.  MUST be kb+jwt, which explicitly types the Key\n         Binding JWT as recommended in Section 3.11 of [RFC8725].\n\n      -  alg: REQUIRED.  A digital signature algorithm identifier such\n         as per IANA \"JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms\"\n         registry.

The base64url-encoded hash value over the\n         Issuer-signed JWT and the selected Disclosures as defined\n         below.\n\n      -  iat: CONDITIONAL.  This claim MUST present when replay detection \n         is achieved using a nonce mechanism.  The value of this claim MUST \n         be the time at which the Key Binding JWT was issued using the \n         syntax defined in [RFC7519]. When this claim is present, the 'rdn' \n         claim MUST also be present. \n\n      -  rnd: CONDITIONAL.

The value type of this \n         claim MUST be a string.

Determine that the Key Binding JWT was created for this Verifier\n           by validating the 'aud' claim.\n\n       9.  Calculate the digest over the Issuer-signed JWT and\n           Disclosures as defined in Section 4.3.1 and verify that it\n           matches the value of the sd_hash claim in the Key Binding\n           JWT.\n\n      10.  Check that the Key Binding JWT is a valid JWT in all other\n           respects, per [RFC7519] and [RFC8725].\n\n   If any step fails, the presentation is not valid and processing MUST\n   be aborted.\n\n```\n",

      "body": "This proposal is produced jointly with Peter Altmann, who discussed the topic with Christian Bormann for additional clarity. At Daniel's suggestion, we are opening this issue for broader discussion.\n\nWe propose amending the current text in **SD-JWT, Section 4.3.2** by appending the following:\n\n**After the current paragraph:**\n\n> If the Verifier requires Key Binding, the Verifier MUST ensure that  \n> the key with which it validates the signature on the Key Binding JWT  \n> is the key specified in the SD-JWT as the Holder's public key. For  \n> example, if the SD-JWT contains a `cnf` value with a `jwk` member, the  \n> Verifier would parse the provided JWK and use it to verify the Key  \n> Binding JWT.\n\n**Add:**\n\n> If the `alg` Header Parameter is HMAC-based (i.e., `HS256`, `HS384`, or `HS512`), the shared secret key **MUST** be derived as:\n>\n> `HMAC-key = HKDF(IKM, keylen, info, salt)`\n>\n> Where:\n> - `HKDF` is the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function as detailed in RFC 5869,\n> - `IKM` is the output of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange between the public key in the `cnf` and the verifier private key,\n> - `keylen` is the output size of the selected HMAC algorithm (256, 384, or 512 bits),\n> - `info` is the ASCII string `\"SD_JWT_KB_\" || alg` (e.g., `\"SD_JWT_KB_HS256\"`),\n> - `salt` is the nonce value.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\n\n**Note that this discussion is limited to algorithms for the key binding JWT. ECDSA will still be used to sign the issuer signed JWT.**\n\nWhen planning for EU Digital Identity Wallet implementation, we identified several strong requirements:\n\n- The Wallet's private key MUST be managed by a server-based HSM.\n- The HSM MUST expose functionality via the PKCS#11 API.\n- Each attestation must have a distinct public key.\n\nDistinct `cnf` key material is used to enable verifier-unlinkable presentations. We want to derive single-show keys from a HSM-protected root key, but cannot find a way to do so while satisfy the above requirements using ECDSA for the key binding JWT. \n\nHowever, it is possible to meet these requirements using the MAC algorithms listed in [RFC 7518 section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.1). \n\nThe proposed HMAC signing approach is fully supported in **mDoc**, where the derivation of the HMAC key is specified in Section 9.1.3.5 of [ISO/IEC 18013-5]. The proposal here mirrors that design as RFC 7518 does not specify how the MAC key should be derived. \n\nWe understand the SD-JWT specification is in its final stages. However, this is a non-breaking and narrowly scoped change that promotes interoperability in HMAC-based deployments. We therefore think it is worth the effort of an update before publication. Furthermore, this addition is critical for anyone aiming to support SD-JWT with single-show binding keys, where HSM resources are accessed using PKCS#11. Without it, we may only be able to guarantee verifier-unlinkability for mDoc (ISO/IEC 18013).",

The specification is clear that the SD JWT signature must be a signature and not HMAC. The point was to say that this only applies to key bindin JWT.\n\nThe requirement to use a HSM originates from EU requirements (EIDAS2). We either need to use a real HSM in the phone (not generally available), an external HSM connected to the phone, or an HSM on a server. HSM on a server is by far the most user-friendly option.\n\nWith regard to the wordings **attestation** and **distinct key**. This is part of our motivation and not proposed text. The eIDAS use of SD JWT (or mDOC) Is to express various attestations. The requirement on unlinkability forces us to use a unique key-binding key for each SD JWT derived from the HSM key pair for the wallet. This can be done using standard Diffie-Hellman for HMAC keys, but can't be done for ECDSA signing. This is why we need HMAC signatures to be specified to the level necessary for interoperability with all verifiers.\n\n\n\nTo all comments above: **Why is this needed, and why not in JOSE**.\n\nIf this is done, it MUST be in SD JWT. The reason is simple. The key binding key is defined in SD JWT, and that is the key that is used to form a HMAC key for SD JWT Key Binding JWT.  JOSE can't specify the use of a key that is not defined in JOSE.\n\nWe absolutely need the specify how the HMAC shared secret is derived from the Holder's public key binding key to achieve interoperability. This is NOT needed e.g. for ECDSA, as the public key is all you need. You simply use that public key to verify the signature.\n\nWhen using ECDH-HMAC as signing algorithm, it is necessary to specify how the HMAC key is derived from the public key in the SD-JWT in order to allow a recipient to validate the Key Binding JWT signature. Without this, the verifier would be clueless on how to verify the ECDH-HMAC signature.\n\nI personally think that it is very reasonable to specify how you use the public key binding key to also verify a Key Binding JWT signed with HMAC.\n\n\nFinally:\n\nWe share this problem with many others. I just don't think many have realized this yet. If this is not fixed, my guess is that we will have to abandon use of SD JWT all together and only use mDoc instead. This may lead to a large user base of this specification will be forced to not use it as well, unless this is specified elsewhere.\n\nOur thought was that since this is defined in mDoc, that it would be appropriate to do in SD JWT as well. But we are aware that this is a last minute request, and that this will cause many to hesitate.",

While alternatives exist, they are significantly harder to justify when PKCS#11 is available. This is why we aim to ensure that key binding is compatible with PKCS#11-based deployments. \n\nBeyond implementation concerns, there is also an issue of specification integrity. As it stands, SD-JWT does not avoid scenarios where compliant issuance results in unverifiable tokens.\n\n@paulbastian rightly highlights a problem. Even if we restrict `alg` to the MAC algorithms in [RFC 7518, Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.1), multiple degrees of freedom remain in how a shared HMAC key is derived. Both the key agreement mechanism and the KDF process are variable and must be standardized to ensure interoperability. Whether this is done through a new JOSE algorithm, an ETSI profile, by simply referring to RFC 9180, or elsewhere is an open question, but it must done. Otherwise SD-JWT continues to permit unverifiable issuance.\n\nIt is possible to explicitly forbid MAC-based approaches, but doing so would effectively exclude server-based architectures that rely on PKCS#11, which is arguably a highly attractive model for many implementers.",

We either need to use a real HSM in the phone (not generally available), an external HSM connected to the phone, or an HSM on a server.

A TEE can host one or more TAs (Trusted Applications). However, at the moment, smart phone manufacturers do no allow to download TAs in their TEE, unless the TA has been developed by themselves.\n\nThe major advantage is that the cryptographic keys are (well) protected and managed by the TEE and that they can only be used by a TA hosted in the TEE. \n\nA TEE and a TA in a smart phone \"is by far the most user-friendly option\" because it can work in a *proximity mode*.\n\n:-)\n\nYou wrote:\n\n> The requirement on unlinkability forces us to use a unique key-binding key for each SD JWT derived from the HSM key pair for the wallet.\n\nI would rephrase this sentence into:\n\n> The requirement on unlinkability forces to use a unique key-binding key for each SD JWT generated randomly by the TEE of the wallet.\n\nYou wrote:\n\n> This can be done using standard Diffie-Hellman for HMAC keys, but can't be done for ECDSA signing.

This may lead to a large user base of this specification will be forced to not use it as well, unless this is specified elsewhere.\n\nAs there are other choices, this does not need \"to be fixed\" in the way you propose. \nThe good news is that we do not \"have to abandon the use of SD JWT all together\". \n\n:-)\n\nThanks both to NIST and IETF, others cryptographic algorithms can readily be used as they have already been registered by IANA many years ago; hence there is no need for JOSE to specify them, nor to register them.\n\n```\nName \t                        Reference \nWOTSP-SHA2_256\t        [RFC8391, Section 5.2]\nWOTSP-SHA2_512\t        [RFC8391, Section 5.2]\nWOTSP-SHAKE_256\t        [RFC8391, Section 5.2]\nWOTSP-SHAKE_512\t        [RFC8391, Section 5.2]\nWOTSP-SHA2_192\t        [SP 800-208, Section 5]\nWOTSP-SHAKE256_256\t[SP 800-208, Section 5]\nWOTSP-SHAKE256_192\t[SP 800-208, Section 5]\n```\n\nSee: https://www.iana.org/assignments/xmss-extended-hash-based-signatures/xmss-extended-hash-based-signatures.xhtml\n\nIn the context of one-time use SD-JWTs, the major advantage of using these algorithms is that they are Post-Quantum resistant and far more performant than any other PQ-resistant ZKP solution being explored at the moment.\n\nWhen using a TA, the *use* of the keys is controlled by the TA. When using a RichOS application, other RichOS applications voluntarily installed by the owner of the smart phone can use the keys as they are not well protected.\n\nAs an example, if Bob (25) accepts to collaborate with Alice (12),  Alice can demonstrate to a Verifier hat she is over 18 while it will be unknown that the trick has been performed with the collaboration of Bob, thanks to the verifier-verifier unlinkability property. \n\nUnfortunately, because collaborative attacks between users are not considered, this threat is not identified in section 9 (Security Considerations) from SD-JWT. \n\nPayments are implemented in payment wallets running in a TEE. Selective disclosure of claims contained in digital credentials shall be implemented in digital identity wallets running in a TEE.\n\nIn practice, it is impossible to implement a secure wallet, unless the Holder application is hosted in a TEE.\n\n@Paul,\n\nI am not on the JOSE mailing list and as I am already registered to too many lists,  I would like to avoid to subscribe to an additional mailing list.\n\n@Peter,\n\nYou wrote:\n\n> It is possible to explicitly forbid MAC-based approaches, but doing so would effectively exclude server-based architectures that rely on PKCS#11, which is arguably a highly attractive model for many implementers.\n\nServer-based architectures that rely on PKCS#11:\n \n- cannot support the proximity mode (e.g., NFC),\n- cannot support cryptographic algorithms that are Post-Quantum resistant,\n- cannot be secure against user collaborative attacks when the verifier-verifier unlinkability property is supported\n... unless you demonstrate the contrary.\n",

My stance has been that the proper layer for that is in the presentation request/response protocol (such as OpenID4VP). Or maybe not the proper layer exactly but the most pragmatic layer given the totality of circumstances. As mentioned [in a comment on that #574](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/574#issuecomment-2877132922) issue, Paul believes it would be more appropriate at the JWS algorithm layer. That's certainly a reasonable perspective but would almost certainly still need some pieces spelled out at the presentation protocol layer. Having said that, I don't think much or even any allowance or guidance exits in the presentation request/response protocol layer that I'm familiar with, OpenID4VP, to facilitate anything like this. To the extent that it's as important as implied here, I'd suggest some of the energy behind this be directed there (while being aware that that document is in the latter stages of the OIDF process).\n> \n> As Danial mentioned [also in a comment on that issue #574](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/574#issuecomment-2876517065) we use the term \"signing\" in SD-JWT to mean HMAC as well as typical asymmetric signatures.  Even though it's not technically correct, it follows the terminology of JWS/JWT that encompass MACs as JSON Web Signatures.

I actually looked at this as it was pointed out that this had been discussed before.\n> \n> Let me start by acknowledging your points.\n> \n> I see your point in defining a separate alg for designated signatures where you can deterministically validate the signature based on a given public key and parameters known or explicitly communicated to the verifier.\n> \n> I can even see the point and value of having a defined identifier for a defined key agreement process.\n> \n> However, even if we would follow your draft, in SD JWT, it seems to me that we would still have to define how to use it in SD JWT.\n> \n> So seeking a first step of a common ground here. Could we both agree that SD JWT in some way would benefit from defining how you can create a SD JWT with key binding key, where the Key Binding JWT can be signed using ECDH-HMAC, AND where the verifier can deterministically verify the signature solely based on information found in the SD JWT presentation?\n> \n> If we can agree on that, we could move on to what the best solution would look like.\n\nWe drafted and implemented the ECDH + HMAC options in the German wallet project using my draft and had no issues with it. So also to @bc-pi  I believe that the important pieces in OpenID4VP do exist, especially the option to transfer the verified public key in it's client metadata object. @Razumain the whole point of my draft was to specify all the header parameters and process so that everything is clear from the alg value, this is also in line with Fully-specified algorithms, which is just about to get published by JOSE. Therefore can you explain what's missing in SD-JWT in your opinion when we would use designated Verifier signatures?\n\n",

          "body": "@bc-pi \nThanks for adding this to OpenID4VP.\n\nTo answer your first question, I'm convinced that using ECDH-HMAC is allowed and not prohibited by SD JWT.\nThe problem is just that if it is used, the verifier does not get all the information necessary to deterministically derive the HMAC key. That needs to be specified somewhere. This discussion was an attempt to see if this could be done in SD JWT as a simple and non breaking lat minute change. A primary motivation for this would be to make mDoc/mDL and SD JWT equal in this regard. mDoc/mDL handles this issue, SD JWT does not.\n\n\nAs to @NeilMadden I do agree with the comment. There is a nonce that could be used, but that is defined in OpenID4VP. As such it is not suitable for this document. But I think there are other possible alternatives. Including a static salt value, a null salt value, a hash of the base JWT. If we would go down this route, I'm sure we can come up with something suitable.\n\n\n**Finally, some thoughts on where to fix this**\n\nI will be totally honest here. This is currently very important for us. Being able to use ECDH-HMAC in an interoperable way will solve some significant problems. And not only for us. mDoc works out of the box, but we really want to use SD JWT if we can. I don't care strongly where this is fixed as long as it if fixed in a way that guarantees interoperability. The preference to this in SD JWT is more tactical. It if is done here, interoperability would be guaranteed from the base specification, and we would not have to battle this in OpenID4VP, ETSI or in the EU commission development of technical specification and implementing acts.\n\nThe second best thing would be to solve this in OpenID4VP, and perhaps @bc-pi can predict better than me if this can be done there. My assumption was that OpenID4VP has an ambition to be agnostic on the actual token format and would be reluctant to do this.\n\nIf we have to do this in ETSI or EU commission, I sense that this will be much harder the and outcome feels uncertain.",

I don't understand the proposed flow between issuer, holder, and verifier; perhaps a data flow section would help. I would think the holder gets a 3+1 part JWS with SVC (which can be `.`-concatenated). Then all you need to present to a verifier is the same data, along with some user proof key signature if the JWT is bound to a user key (for which a property is added in the SD-JWT-R, if I understood correctly; more details would be helpful here).\r\n",

Consider just a bit more about what a SD-JWT-R is/does. Borrowing from https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-fett-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-00.html#name-sd-jwt-release-sd-jwt-r maybe \"This document also defines a format for so-called SD-JWT Releases (SD-JWT-R), which conveys a subset of the claim values of an SD-JWT in a verifiable way\" or something along those lines.  Honestly, after reading the doc a few times, I'm unsure whether a SD-JWT-R is the encoded SVC or SD-JWT and SVC Combined Format. Or both. Or something else. And is it for releasing to the holder or the verifier or both? I think there's room for the various terms to be tightened up and clarified. And also in how they are used.",

Probably aklso the encryption, I'd move your code to another PR aligned to this, or you or together, the same for me.\r\n\r\nI'd prevent to leave this code as PR and moving ahead the legacy code in the meantime, this would cause to me to spend more effort to aling the code.

If this is it: ok by me.\r\n\r\n> Throw out all 'print' statements above\r\n\r\nFound only once and replace with a logger.info\r\n\r\n> Instead produce the CLI output from the replacements dict that is created below (e.g., print replacements['structured-sd-jwt-claims'] instead of the print_repr in Line 172.\r\n\r\nDo you mean that we should produce all the items in the replacements dict and then print_repr of these?\r\n\r\n",

I don't think that typ value(s) should be defined or mandated by this draft.\r\n> \r\n> [RFC 8725 - JSON Web Token Best Current Practices](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8725.html) talks about using explicit typing as a security mechanism to prevent \"Cross-JWT Confusion\" but typing something as an SD-JWT doesn't accomplish the same thing and might preclude use in contexts where there is a typ already in use (i.e. at+jwt for an access token per https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068#section-2.1).\r\n\r\nmmhh ... Ok, we used that text in OIDC Federation when we decided to adopt a typ for entity statements and trust marks.\r\nIf I understand your comment: you're saying that SD-JWT can be used also in an access_token so we have the requirement to not force a specific type for this JWT.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense ... even if I can't see how an access token (or an id token) then requires a SD-JWT-R to resolve the claims value. Can we have a clear rationale for this? How SD-JWT could be used in existing JWT typ, this will help the born of a section related to this topic, in the draft if we agree    ",

With more examples (W3C VC) and more example code (claims merging) to come, things will get more complicated.\r\n\r\nI therefore moved the examples into a separate directory as YAML files. I used YAML, because this means that we can store all data required for each example as separate JSON documents in one YAML file (JSON is a subset of YAML). \r\n\r\nThe code can now be called with a YAML file as the input and will run the demo for the example defined in the file. This will make it easier for us to add more examples in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso in this pull request:\r\n\r\n- Cleaned up the code to produce just one example each time - there is no need to calculate all examples when only one is used in each run\r\n- Cleaned up the code to produce both the CLI output and the spec examples from the same set of data to avoid repetitions\r\n- This means that placeholders in main.md are now strictly named as follows: `example-{example_id}-{artifact_id}`, where `artifact_id` refers to the identifier of the data produced in the example run (see `sd_jwt` file).\r\n- Fix for example output: serialized SVC was not shown, but serialized SD-JWT twice\r\n- Renamed `_sel_exp` to `_artifacts` (not sure what `_sel_exp` was meant to say)\r\n- Fix for no_randomness: RNG was seeded to static value even when no_randomness was not used",

It actually gives the impression that linkability is unavoidable if this RFC is implemented, since for a solution it only refers to undefined \u2018advanced cryptographic schemes outside the scope of this specification\u2019. However, in reality an issuer can completely avoid linkability on the basis of unique values encoded in the SD-JWT, simply by ensuring that each SD-JWT can be used for only one transaction. Of course, this places stringent demands on the connectivity of the holder app and the capacity of the issuer\u2019s systems for generating and communicating new SD-JWTs to its holder apps. To lessen these burdens, the issuer could also choose other approaches, for example \r\n> - Equipping each holder app with a pool of (for instance) 20 different SD-JWTs. The app would then randomly pick one of these SD-JWTs for every transaction, and re-start the pool once all JWTs have been used. \r\n> - Allowing each SD-JWT to be used multiple times, but only for a limited time.\r\n> \r\n> The SD-JWT mechanism therefore allows every issuer to find the correct balance between holder linkability and mitigation costs and efforts, based on a risk analysis for their specific situation.\r\nPlease re-write section 8.2 in the light of the above suggestions.\r\n",

Such a spec/profile would need to define that hash function for use at the SD-JWT layer as a single input to single digest output thing. But it could map/profile something like PBKDF2 to do that or define a 30 billion iteration sha2 thing. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much of that we want to say here.

Which is kind of an edge case but probably not what we want. I borrowed that text from DPoP where an AD had suggested it be more restrictive with respect to the registry. But I didn't love it there and your question reminds me of that and that it's probably less appropriate here. I'll rephrase this sentence so as not to be prohibitive. ",

And so would reject HB-JWTs that have an `iat` that falls outside some policy based window.  But something like that should probably said more explicitly because `iat` doesn't have any normative validity rules on its own. Maybe, \"Check that Holder Binding JWT was created within an acceptable timeframe as indicated by the `iat` claim\" or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nFWIW the idea is similar to DPoP and [Checking DPoP Proofs](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop-16.html#name-checking-dpop-proofs) does have some text that attempts to say the the creation time of the JWT needs to be within an acceptable window.\r\n\r\nAnd rather than mentioning the`nbf` and `exp` claims maybe have another general item like \"Ensure that the Holder Binding JWT is valid in all other respects per [@!RFC7519].\"  that's more of a catch-all.

While fixing that, I decided to remove the SHOULD recommending the use of an unregistered claim name `_sd_jwt`.  I also tried to align the example enveloping payload a bit with a move minimal set of claims similar to those used in key binding.   \r\n\r\nI realize I probably should have just fixed the section title and not expanded the scope of the changes. But there I was and these few little changes were so inviting...  \r\n\r\nSee it here: https://drafts.oauth.net/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/enveloping-sec-fixup/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt.html#section-7",

I personally would prefer to add biometric binding in parallel to the usual \"cnf\".\r\n- The PID rule book does not defined biometric data yet. I suggest to include this in the example once there is more clarity around that.\r\n- Section A.3. already has a SD-JWT VC example.  I think this example should go into the SD-JWT VC spec as it is another instance of an SD-JWT VC. ",

We should replace this with a more intuitive word.  We could reintroduce \"Presentation\" for this, with the allowance that one might \"present\" either a Presentation or an SD-JWT.  Or we could pick another term, suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nI have tried to be fairly minimal in the changes here.  In particular, I have not changed any of the algorithms, though I suspect they would be clearer if a bit more separate.

Thus, we should talk about them as separate things.\r\n\r\n@bifurcation, I believe you're missing my point.  To correctly accept a key-bound SD-JWT, the recipient MUST have code that:\r\n\r\n1. Verifies that a key binding is present in the SD-JWT.\r\n2. Verifies the key binding signature.\r\n\r\nOnly then can the recipient know that the SD-JWT is key bound.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a separate media type asserting that the SD-JWT is key bound *doesn't* remove the need for the recipient to verify the presence and signature of the key binding as above, if it wants a key-bound SD-JWT.  If anything, introducing a key-bound-SD-JWT media type could *increase* the probability that recipients would be lazy thinking that \"The media type says it's key-bound so that must be true.\" and not do steps 1 and 2 above - which is what actually needs to be done to securely accept a key-bound SD-JWT.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a separate media type doesn't help from a security perspective, and in practice, it may hurt.  For that reason, I am opposed to introducing a separate media type.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, @ve7jtb made similar comments at the microphone during the OAuth WG meeting at IETF 119 in Brisbane.",

Thus, the signature on the Key Binding JWT, in addition to proving\r\nKey Binding, also assures the authenticity and integrity of the set of\r\nDisclosures the Holder disclosed.

And that the `kb_jwt` has to be there too.\r\n\r\nAnd now I see that is what is said in the General JSON Serialization subsection below. Sorry!\r\n\r\nBut a bit more clarity here might still be good? I don't know that this is that much better but maybe:\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\none is used for the Disclosures and Key Binding JWT. \r\n```\r\n\r\nSide note: using only the first one feels kinda icky TBH and the general issue was one reason I'd tried to avoid using the unprotected header for the SD-JWT pieces. But it seems a pragmatic way to do this given all the factors and constraints involved.",

How the holder selects disclosures to reveal in the context of recursion\r\n3. How the verifier unwinds recursive disclosures\r\n\r\n(3) is adequately covered in the verification algorithm.  The other two are currently uncovered.   This PR clarifies (1) and (2).  \r\n\r\nAlgorithm (1) doesn't really need formal definition for interoperability; an issuer can follow any process that ends up with an SD-JWT that will verify.  However, it's useful to (1) provide an illustration, (2) provider a reminder that you have to go from most-specific redaction to least, from the leaves of the AST toward the issuer-signed claims, and (3) provide a clear requirement that an SD-JWT must contain any intermediate recursive disclosures.  This PR adds a section that does these things.\r\n\r\nFor algorithm (2), I simply added a step to the holder processing that verifies that the disclosure selection process got all the required disclosures (including the intermediate ones).  We could also be more prescriptive, providing a concrete algorithm that adds the required intermediate disclosures.",

By my count, this addresses 36 of my 59 review comments at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/oauth/5V6nVIfYw3BxsayLg1iY-YRUxdc/ - leaving 23.  Those that I believe have not yet been addressed are listed below.  I assume they will be addressed in subsequent PRs and/or discussed on list. \r\n\r\nI'm approving because I'm fine with this existing set being merged in now.  (Although a few of the remaining ones are also purely editorial, so could also be added. here.)\r\n\r\nSection 1. [Introduction](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-introduction):  The usage of \u201cHolder\u201d in \u201cused a number of times by the user (the \"Holder\" of the JWT)\u201d inconsistent with its usage in the definitions, which defines \u201cHolder\u201d as being \u201can entity\u201d.  The usage here in the introduction makes the holder into a person rather than an entity.  Please adjust the language here to not confuse the user who utilizes the holder with the holder itself.\r\nSection 1. [Introduction](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-introduction):  In \u201c\"Claims\" here refers to both object properties (name-value pairs) as well as array elements.\u201d change \u201carray elements\u201d to \u201celements in arrays that are the values of name/value pairs\u201d (or something like that).  Without saying what the array elements are, readers will be confused about what\u2019s being referred to.  I\u2019d apply this clarification in 4.1. [SD-JWT and Disclosures](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-sd-jwt-and-disclosures) and other applicable locations as well.\r\nSection 1. [Introduction](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-introduction):  In \u201cthey hold the private key associated to the SD-JWT\u201d, change \u201cassociated to\u201d to \u201cassociated with\u201d.\r\nSection 1. [Introduction](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-introduction):  During IESG and/or RFC Editor review, we\u2019re likely going to be asked to add a reference for JSON-LD at \u201cSD-JWT can be used with any JSON-based representation of claims, including JSON-LD.\u201d  If we don\u2019t want that, I\u2019d delete \u201c, including JSON-LD\u201d now.\r\nSection 1.1. [Feature Summary](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-feature-summary):  In \u201cA format for enabling selective disclosure in nested JSON data structures, supporting selectively disclosable object properties (name-value pairs) and array elements\u201d, consider expanding \u201carray elements\u201d in the same manner as the preceding comment to make the meaning more evident.\r\nSection 1.2. [Conventions and Terminology](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-conventions-and-terminology):  I suggest moving the \u201cbase64url\u201d definition to the Terms and Definitions section and use a parallel structure to that at https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-2.  Specifically, say \u201cThe \u201cbase64url\u201d term denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].\u201d  Then introduce the rest of the definitions with the phrase \u201cThese terms are defined by this specification:\u201d as is done in RFC 7519.  The current presentation is fairly jarring.\r\nSection 5.2.2. [Disclosures for Array Elements](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-disclosures-for-array-eleme):  Some readers and implementers will be confused at this point because the array disclosure doesn\u2019t indicate what Claim Name the disclosed array element corresponds to.  Please say here how the Claim Name information is communicated.  At the very least, add a forward reference saying that the way the array element disclosure is associated with the Claim Name is described in 5.2.4.2. [Array Elements](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-array-elements).\r\nSection 5.2.4.2. [Array Elements](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-array-elements):  I suggest adding an example also enabling disclosing a second array element, so that the syntax will be clear to readers.  In other words, show what \u201cunless a matching Disclosure for the second element is received\u201d would look like.  Or add a forward reference showing a place that it\u2019s done.\r\nSection 5.2.6. [Recursive Disclosures](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-recursive-disclosures):  Change \u201cconceal presence\u201d to \u201cconceal the presence\u201d.\r\nSection 5.3. [Key Binding JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-key-binding-jwt):  Change \u201cMUST NOT be none.\u201d to \u201cIt MUST NOT be \"none\".\u201d.\r\nSection 5.3.2. [Validating the Key Binding JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-validating-the-key-binding-):  In \u201cif the SD-JWT contains a cnf value with a jwk member, the Verifier could parse the provided JWK and use it to verify the Key Binding JWT.\u201d, change \u201ccould\u201d to \u201cMUST\u201d.  Make this normative to increase interoperability!\r\nSection 6.1. [Issuance](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-issuance):  There are many places from here on where the label \u201cSHA-256 Hash\u201d is used, for instance \u201cSHA-256 Hash: jsu9yVulwQQlhFlM_3JlzMaSFzglhQG0DpfayQwLUK4\u201d.  Change all of these to \u201cBase64url-Encoded SHA-256 Hash\u201d for correctness.\r\nSection 6.1. [Issuance](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-issuance):  Change \u201cThe following Key Binding JWT payload was created and signed for this presentation by the Holder:\u201d to \u201cThe following Key Binding JWT Claims Set was created and signed for this presentation by the Holder:\u201d, again, to use the standard JWT claims terminology.\r\nSection 8.1. [Verification of the SD-JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-verification-of-the-sd-jwt):  Delete \u201cnbf\u201d from \u201cclaims such as nbf, iat, and exp\u201d and everywhere else in the spec, other than in 10.7. [Selectively-Disclosable Validity Claims](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-selectively-disclosable-val), where both \u201ciat\u201d and \u201cnbf\u201d should be listed, as described in my comment there.  \u201ciat\u201d (Issued At) is a standard validity claim in JWT tokens (for instance, ID Tokens), whereas \u201cnbf\u201d (Not Before) is rarely used, since it is only useful when future-dating tokens, which is rare.\r\nSection 10.1. [Mandatory Signing of the Issuer-signed JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-mandatory-signing-of-the-is):  \u2026  Also, the post-quantum language seems superfluous and non-actionable, so I\u2019d delete it.\r\nSection 10.7. [Selectively-Disclosable Validity Claims](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-selectively-disclosable-val):  Add \u201ciat (Issued At) to the validity claims list before \u201cnbf\u201d, and change \u201cnbf (Not Before)\u201d to \u201cnbf (Not Before) (if present)\u201d.  \u201ciat\u201d (Issued At) is a standard validity claim in JWT tokens (for instance, ID Tokens), whereas \u201cnbf\u201d (Not Before) is rarely used, since it is only useful when future-dating tokens, which is rare.  Change all uses of \u201cnbf\u201d to \u201ciat\u201d elsewhere in the spec.\r\nSection 11.1. [Storage of Signed User Data](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-storage-of-signed-user-data):  Change \u201cOpenID Connect\u201d to \u201cOpenID Connect [OpenID.Core]\u201d.\r\nSection 12. [Acknowledgements](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-acknowledgements):  Consider sorting the acknowledgements alphabetically by last name, which is the usual convention.\r\nSection 14.2. [Informative References](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-informative-references):  Update the reference \u201c[I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc]\u201d to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-04.\r\nSection A.1. [Simple Structured SD-JWT](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-simple-structured-sd-jwt): Change \u201callowing to separately disclose individual members of the claim\u201d to \u201callowing separate disclosure of individual members of the claim\u201d.\r\nSection A.5. [Elliptic Curve Key Used in the Examples](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-elliptic-curve-key-used-in-): Change \u201cThe public key used to validate a Key Binding JWT can be found in the examples as the content of the cnf claim.\u201d to \u201cThe public key used to validate a Key Binding JWT can be found in the examples as the value of the jwk member of the cnf claim.\u201d\r\nSection Appendix B. [Disclosure Format Considerations](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-10.html#name-disclosure-format-considera): At the end of the paragraph introduced by \u201c1. Canonicalization\u201d, consider adding the sentence \u201cCanonicalization schemes have a long history of creating interoperability problems in practice.\u201d\r\nEverywhere:  Consider changing the name \u201c\u2026\u201d to something more indicative of its function, such as \u201c_sd_element\u201d or \u201c_sd_item\u201d.  Or alternatively, at least provide rationale for why that non-obvious name was chosen.",

But I did add this one mention of the term in the location that @awoie requested it in https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/issues/443. And it was already used in the text at the end of [8.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt#section-8.3-6). And the just merged https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/pull/457 sprinkled in a few casual uses of it too. So I think it's sufficient enough. \r\n\r\nAlso we have a fair number of kinda similar terms/phrases that are used in the doc but not formally introduced in the the terminology section. Which I think is fine. But putting this one there might be somewhat inconsistent and beg the question about other similar terms/phrases being there too. ",

Spell out SD-JWT on first use\r\n4. s/the verifier would like assurance/the holder can optionally provide assurance/\r\n5.

But have you read all of ISO/IEC 29100:2024 and are all of it's principles applicable to SD-JWT? I don't know, I've only glanced at it. But I don't personally find content like \"The privacy principles of [@ISO.29100] should be adhered to.\" to be particularity helpful in a document like this and think it'd be better off without a vague and general statement to go see this other document that's not easily accessed. That how it's not easily accessed keeps changing is more a reminder that, in my opinion anyway, it never should have been referenced from SD-JWT in the first place. ",

With regard to the access token (which is another popular application of JWTs), you already have the decoupling as the client receives the JWT and the resource server verifies it (not that I believe that SD-JWT does make much sense in this context but I think you should not neglect OAuth when talking about JWTs in general). What's new is that the issuer cannot make any assumptions on how the intermediate party is going to use the JWT, i.e. typically the issuer does not know the audiences of a JWT at the time of issuance and consequently cannot minimize the information shared with a verifier/audience in a practical way. The previous intro kind of captured that.",

          "body": "I have objections/concerns with this text.\r\n\r\nThe text states:\r\n\r\n> \"SD-JWT conceals only the values that aren't revealed. It does not\r\n> meet standard security notations for anonymous credentials. In\r\n> particular Verifiers and Issuers can know when they have seen the same\r\n> credential no matter what fields have been opened, even none of them.\r\n> This behavior may not accord with what users naively expect or are\r\n> lead to expect from UX interactions and lead to them make choices they\r\n> would not otherwise make. Workarounds such as issuing multiple\r\n> credentials at once and using them only one time can help for keeping\r\n> Verifiers from linking different showing.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThe text is confusing because it addresses two different topics:\r\nVerifier-Verifier unlinkability and Issuer-Verifier Unlinkability. \r\n\r\nThe last sentence means that problem can be addressed for the Verifier-Verifier unlinkability.\r\nIt is not necessary to use strong sentences like:\r\n\r\n> \" It does not meet standard security notations for anonymous credentials\"\r\n\r\n which are not explained.\r\n\r\nThe sentence terminates with:\r\n\r\n> but cannot work for Issuers.\r\n\r\nThis is the case for the Issuer-Verifier unlinkability.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is text in section 10.1 that states :\r\n\r\n> Issuer/Verifier unlinkability with a colluding or compromised Verifier cannot be achieved in salted-hash based selective disclosure approaches, such as SD-JWT, as the issued credential with the Issuer's signature is directly presented to the Verifier, who can forward it to the Issuer.\r\n\r\nSo the proposed text is redondant.\r\n\r\nHowever, the use of the wording \"colluding or compromised\" does not seem to be appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Issuer will not directly \"collude\" with a Verifier. However, a national authority might oblige a Verifier to reveal the SD-JWT that has been used for a given access and afterwards might also oblige the Issuer to reveal the identity of the End-User. \r\n\r\nThis situation can only happen if both the Issuer and the Verifier memorize the SD-JWTs they have respectively issued or received.\r\n\r\nSo saying that \"Issuer/Verifier unlinkability with a colluding or compromised Verifier cannot be achieved in salted-hash based selective disclosure approaches\" is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nChange into:\r\n\r\n> Issuer/Verifier unlinkability can be achieved in salted-hash based selective disclosure approaches, such as SD-JWT, if the Verifier does not memorize the SD-JWTs that it has received.\r\n\r\n> On the contrary, if the Verifier memorizes the SD-JWTs that it has received and if the Issuer memorizes the SD-JWTs that it has issued, then some authority might oblige a Verifier to reveal the SD-JWT that has been used for a given access and then oblige the Issuer of these SD-JWTs to reveal the identity of the End-Users.\r\n\r\nThe notions of \"honest\" or \"dishonest\" Verifier are not relevant. If a Verifier obeys to a local law, it should not be considered to be \"dishonest\".  By definition, an Issuer is trusted to be honest.\r\n\r\nIn section 10.1, the following text should be removed:\r\n\r\n> In considering Issuer/Verifier unlinkability, it is important to note the potential for an asymmetric power dynamic between Issuers and Verifiers. This dynamic can compel an otherwise honest Verifier into collusion. For example, a governmental Issuer might have the authority to mandate that a Verifier report back information about the credentials presented to it. \r\n> Legal requirements could further enforce this, explicitly undermining Issuer/Verifier unlinkability. Similarly, a large service provider issuing credentials might implicitly pressure Verifiers into collusion by incentivizing participation in their larger ecosystem. \r\n> Deployers of SD-JWT must be aware of these potential power dynamics, mitigate them as much as possible, and/or make the risks transparent to the user.\r\n> Contrary to that, Issuer/Verifier unlinkability with an honest Verifier can generally be achieved. \r\n\r\nIf the Verifier does not memorize the SD-JWTs that it has received, then the risk can be avoided.\r\n\r\nBut there are also implications with section 10.2 , where the text states:\r\n\r\n> All involved parties SHOULD store SD-JWTs containing privacy-sensitive data only for as long as needed, including in log files.\r\n> \r\n> After Issuance, Issuers SHOULD NOT store the Issuer-signed JWT or the respective Disclosures if they contain privacy-sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThe term \" privacy-sensitive data\" is not defined.  A SD-JWT necessarily contains 'privacy-sensitive data'. \r\n\r\nThe first sentence would prevent to support the Issuer/Verifier unlinkability that can be achieved. \r\nThis first sentence should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe second sentence should be shortened and changed into:\r\n\r\n> After Issuance, Issuers SHOULD NOT store the Issuer-signed JWT.\r\n\r\nIn section 10.2, the text continues with:\r\n\r\n> Holders SHOULD store SD-JWTs only in encrypted form, and, wherever possible, use hardware-backed encryption in particular for the private Key Binding key. Decentralized storage of data, e.g., on user devices, SHOULD be preferred for user credentials over centralized storage. \r\n>\r\n> Expired SD-JWTs SHOULD be deleted as soon as possible.\r\n> \r\n> After Verification, Verifiers SHOULD NOT store the Issuer-signed JWT or the respective Disclosures if they contain privacy-sensitive data. It may be sufficient to store the result of the verification and any user data that is needed for the application.\r\n\r\nThe first recommendation is an implementation option. It should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe second recommendation might be misunderstood, as it would mean that Holders SHOULD NOT delete NON-EXPIRED SD-JWTs. It should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe third recommendation can also be misunderstood, as it would mean that Verifiers SHOULD store the Issuer-signed JWT or the respective Disclosures *if* they DO NOT contain privacy-sensitive data. \r\n\r\nIt should be changed into:\r\n\r\n> After Verification, Verifiers SHOULD NOT store the Issuer-signed JWT. It may be sufficient to store the result of the verification and any user data that is needed for the application.\r\n\r\nThis closes the loop: if neither the Issuer nor the Verifier stores the SD-JWT, then Issuer/Verifier unlinkability can be achieved. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
